#### it's like a testsplit, but fancy and also schmancy

a testsplit per label category, to ensure that every category is present
        
----
### Examples

Assume the following DataFrame:
```Python
df = DataFrame(data= {"Column A":[10, 14, 12, 13, 9, 5, 13, 16, 18, 4, 12],
"Column B": ["Cat1", "Cat1", "Cat2", "Cat2", "Cat2", "Cat2", "Cat2", "Cat2", "Cat2", "Cat2", "Cat2"]})
print(df)
```
|| Column A | Column B
:- | -: | -:
0 | 10 | Cat1
1 | 14 | Cat1
2 | 12 | Cat2
3 | 13 | Cat2
4 | 9 | Cat2
5 | 5 | Cat2
6 | 13 | Cat2
7 | 16 | Cat2
8 | 18 | Cat2
9 | 4 | Cat2
10 | 12 | Cat2

If we assume further that Column B contains the label categories, we'd
run the risk of eliminating Cat1 by doing a train test split at 50%.

So, to preserve every existing category, the split will instead be made
on every single subset of categories.

As an example for Cat1:
```Python
subset = df[df["Column B"] == "Cat1"]
X = subset.drop("Column B", axis= 1)
y = subset["Column B"]
if isinstance(y, Series): y = DataFrame(y)
X_tr, X_te, y_tr, y_te = \
    train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.5, random_state = 42)
print(y_tr)
```
|| Column B
:- | -:
0 | Cat1

This is done for every unique entry of the given label column, so that a random pick of train and test data is done for every category separately.

If this was done for "Cat1" and "Cat2", it would look like this:

|| Column B
:- | -:
0 | Cat1
4 | Cat2
6 | Cat2
5 | Cat2
8 | Cat2

To shorten the process, the method fancy_schmancy_testsplit can be used in this way:

```Python
from FancySchmancyTestsplit.fst import fancy_schmancy_testsplit
from pandas import DataFrame
df = DataFrame(data= {"Column A":[10, 14, 12, 13, 9, 5, 13, 16, 18, 4, 12],
"Column B": ["Cat1", "Cat1", "Cat2", "Cat2", "Cat2", "Cat2", "Cat2", "Cat2", "Cat2", "Cat2", "Cat2"]})
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = \
    fancy_schmancy_testsplit(data= df,
                            label_column= "Column B",
                            test_split= 0.5,
                            seed= 42
                            )
print(y_train)
```
|| Column B
:- | -:
0 | Cat1
4 | Cat2
6 | Cat2
5 | Cat2
8 | Cat2
