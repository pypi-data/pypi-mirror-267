A plugin that will filter pytest's test collection using a json file.
It will read a json file provided with a --json argument in pytest command line
(or in pytest.ini), search the 'markers' key and automatically add -m option to
the command line for filtering out the tests marked with disabled markers.

----

This `pytest`_ plugin was generated with `Cookiecutter`_ along with `@hackebrot`_'s `cookiecutter-pytest-plugin`_ template.


Requirements
------------

* json >= 2.0.9


Installation
------------

You can install "pytest-himark" via `pip`_ from `PyPI`_::

    $ pip install pytest-himark


Usage
-----

After installing this plugin, pytest will automatically load it when launching tests.
You will simply need to add the --json option to the command line with the path to the
json containing the markers you want to enable. Alternatively, you can add the --json
option and the path in the pytest.ini directly, in the addopts variable.

Example:
    - pytest.ini:

    .. code-block:: INI

        addopts = --json=path/to/my/config.json

    - config.json:

.. code-block:: JSON

        {
            "markers": {
                "my_marker1": true,
                "my_marker2": true,
                "my_marker3": false,
                "my_marker4": false
            }
        }

..

    Launching pytest now will automatically add he following to the command line:

.. code-block:: python

    >> pytest -m "(my_marker1 or my_marker2) and not (my_marker3 or my_marker4)"
