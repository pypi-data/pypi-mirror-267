# Pynanopore: A modular python app for single molecule electrophysiology data.

Pynanopore serves as a sophisticated toolkit for analyzing single molecules, designed to interpret complex states within nanopore data automatically. It accomplishes this by constructing a virtual representation of the nanopore mechanism using an electrical circuit analogy. This approach capitalizes on the initial electrical changes that occur when a molecule passes through the nanopore to measure the interactions between the pore and the molecule accurately.

Tiny pores on the nanometer scale have shown promising applications in the field of biotechnology, with uses ranging from DNA sequencing to measuring forces at the single-molecule level, and even in identifying molecules by mass on a one-by-one basis. The sophisticated data analysis and modeling techniques provided by Pynanopore are key to significantly enhancing the accuracy of measuring how molecules engage with these nanopores in all these high-tech applications.
