SyllogisTIC

A simple Lua build system for the TIC-80. It supports includes, exports (kinda),
and modifying named feature inclusion on import, all via magic comments.

Install:

    pip install syllogistic

Usage:

    syllogistic yourfile.lua.tic


Support for other languages might be added later if there's enough
demand.

Out of Scope:

- Proper imports (see the docs for why)
- Preprocessor logic like #define, macros, #ifdef, but open to reconsideration
