The story follows the journey of Joel, a smuggler, and Ellie, a teenage girl who may be the key to finding a cure for a deadly fungal infection that has ravaged the world.

The show's production value is top-notch, with stunning visuals and cinematography that capture the bleak and haunting atmosphere of a post-apocalyptic world. The use of practical effects and makeup is impressive and adds to the overall immersion of the story.

Overall, "The Last of Us" is an outstanding TV series that does justice to the source material. It's a must-watch for fans of the video game and anyone who enjoys gripping and emotional storytelling. I would rate it a 9 out of 10.
