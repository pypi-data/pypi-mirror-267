# AlphaFetcher

`AlphaFetcher` facilitates fetching and downloading protein metadata and related files from the 
[AlphaFold Protein Structure Database](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/) 
using Uniprot access codes.

---

## 🌟 Features

- **Batch Import**: Input single or multiple Uniprot access codes seamlessly.
  
- **Parallel Processing**: Efficiently fetch metadata using multithreading.
  
- **Flexible Downloads**: Choose among various file types - PDB, CIF, BCIF, PAE image, and PAE data files.
  
- **Optimal Performance**: Easily adjust the number of workers for threaded tasks.

## 🔧 Installation

We recommend PyPI installation:

```bash
pip install alphafetcher
```

---

## 💡 Usage

```python
from alphafetcher import AlphaFetcher

# Instantiate the fetcher
# The base_savedir parameter allows you to set a base directory where files will be saved.
# Inside this directory, two separate directories for pdb and cif files will be created.
fetcher = AlphaFetcher(base_savedir="my_savedir")

# Add desired Uniprot access codes
fetcher.add_proteins(["A1KXE4", "H0YL14", "B2RXH2", "A8MVW5"])

# Retrieve metadata
fetcher.fetch_metadata(multithread=True, workers=4)
# Metadata available at fetcher.metadata_dict

# Commence download of specified files
fetcher.download_all_files(pdb=True, cif=True, multithread=True, workers=4)
```

## 📜 Documentation

### Initialization

- **`AlphaFetcher(base_savedir: str)`**
  - *Description*: Initialize the fetcher with a base save directory. The `base_savedir` is where the downloaded pdb and cif files will be stored. Inside this directory, two subdirectories will be automatically created: one for pdb files and another for cif files.
  - *Parameters*:
    - `base_savedir`: The base directory where the pdb and cif files will be saved.


### Methods

- **`add_proteins(proteins: Union[str, List[str]])`**
  - *Description*: Add the provided Uniprot access codes for fetching. A single string or a list of strings are 
    accepted. 

- **`fetch_metadata(multithread: bool = False, workers: int = 10)`**
  - *Description*: Extracts metadata corresponding to the supplied Uniprot access codes. This metadata is used to 
    download the relevant files and is stored in ```fetcher.metadata_dict```, assuming the notation of the example
    above is followed.
  
- **`download_all_files(uniprot_access: str, pdb: bool = False, cif: bool = False, bcif: bool = False, 
  pae_image:bool = False, pae_data: bool = False)`**
  - *Description*: Initiates download for the specified file types linked to the given Uniprot codes.
  - Specify the types of files to be downloaded by changing the values of their parameters to True.

*For a comprehensive guide, users are encouraged to view the docstrings incorporated within the source code.*

## ⚠️ Limitations

Always respect the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database terms of service, ensuring not to flood it with excessive 
concurrent requests. Consider adjusting the number of workers to reduce the requests density.
