## [Unreleased]

## [0.8.1] - Apr 8, 2024

### Changed

* Internal-only change: Update CICD workflows to use [`ntsjenkins` shared library](https://confluence.uoregon.edu/x/TQRaGw)


## [0.8.0] - March 5, 2023

### Added

* `uologging.DownloadTracer`
    * See [examples of "Tracing Concurrent Downloads" in the User Guide](./user-guide.md#tracing-concurrent-downloads)
* Emit a `DeprecationWarning` when a deprecated alias is used.

## [0.7.3]

* Fix for Regression: Performance tracing raises an error when it attempt to capture/log arguments.

## [0.7.2]

> Regression: Performance tracing raises an error when it attempt to capture/log arguments.

* Fix for regression: When `init_console_logging` called multiple times on a single package, it 'inits' multiple times.
    * `init_console_logging` can be called many times for a single package --  it will not add ConsoleHandlers any calls past the first.
    * I.e. This package will not add redundant messages to the console if one calls `init_console('mypackage')` multiple times.

## [0.7.1]

> Regression: When `init_console_logging` called multiple times on a single package, it 'inits' multiple times -- it should only 'init' once.

* Enable using uologging `init...` methods with multiple packages.
* Now using [Hatch](https://github.com/pypa/hatch) for managing development environments, CICD, and builds.
* The following aliases have been added:
```
init_console = init_console_logging
init_syslog = init_syslog_logging
set_verbosity = set_logging_verbosity
```

## [0.7.0]

* Added `name` parameter to all logger-configuring functions. Allowing configuring particular loggers (instead of always configuring the root logger).

## [0.6.1]

* Fix the `trace` function context, to show the correct file and line number of the invoked function.
    *  Only works for Python >= 3.8

## [0.6.0]

* The `trace` function decorator now takes an optional "capture_args" argument.

## [0.5.0]

* NOT Backwards Compatible: No longer require the 'root package name' argument.
    * We are now using the true "root" logger provided by logging (instead of working on the parent package)
* Provide a `trace` function decorator that will log at start and end of a function, and the elapsed time of the function.
* 'Initialize' functions can be called multiple times, but will only run one-time.
    * This enables the 'init__logging' functions to be called during module initialization without fear of duplicate logging handlers accidentally getting initialized.

## [0.4.0]

* NOT Backwards Compatible: The verbosity_flag is now required for 'set_logging_verbosity' function.

## [0.3.0]

* NOT Backwards Compatible: Remove optional verbosity flag from 'init_console_logging' function.
* Enable syslog logging.

## [0.2.1]

* Documentation updates.

## [0.2.0]

* Provide `add_verbosity_flag` function, as an alternate method to enable '-vv' in CLI tools.

## [0.1.0]

* Enable pretty console logging for an entire package.
* Provide argparse 'parent parser' solution, enabling '-vv' in CLI tools.
