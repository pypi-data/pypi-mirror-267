This module contains functions useful for managing an archive of files. Whether that be checking equality, removing,
hashing or finding duplicates.

class Archyve:
    """
    Archyve can be used to manage large file stores. It has features specifically for media, but works on any kind of
    file. It can identify duplicates, remove, move, sort and manage files en masse. Looping through the archyve will
    cause the underlying generator to be exhausted - this will result in anomalies like the length being 0. To reset
    archyve to its original state you can use the reset method, however, this will remove all filters. It is therefore
    best practice to do all the set-up before iterating over the archyve.

    NB: If you run into recursion errors you may need to use sys.setrecursionlimit()
