Non-Equillibrium Green's Functions solvers and examples for educational purposes. Limited to a 1D linear chain for now.
See the [documentation](https://liborsold.github.io/fuNEGF/).

Install with **```pip install fuNEGF```** from the [project's PyPI repository](https://pypi.org/project/fuNEGF/).

## Structure
* the ```LinearChain``` class including the NEGF routines resides in ```src/fuNEGF/models.py```
* a Jupyter notebook ```src/examples/one-dimensional_channel.ipynb``` contains the linear chain case study with the underlying physics explained
* a Jupyter notebok ```src/examples/time_complexity.ipynb``` contains a time complexity study of constructing the model $\mathcal{O}(N)$ and calculating the transmission coefficient $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$

## Example
A linear chain with a single or multiple on-site potential impurities will present a chemical potential (occupation) drop, which may not be apparent unless a phase relaxation is included, as shown below.
An additional momentum relaxation will cause a non-zero chemical potential slope in between the impurity regions.
The complete description and calculation are provided in the ```src/examples/one-dimensional_channel.ipynb``` notebook.

## Features
* object-oriented
* with automatically generated [online documentation](https://liborsold.github.io/fuNEGF/)
* PEP8-compliant
* including unit tests
