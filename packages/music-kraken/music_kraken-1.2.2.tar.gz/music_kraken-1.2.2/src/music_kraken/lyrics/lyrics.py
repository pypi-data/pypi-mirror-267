This whole Part is bodgy as hell and I need to rewrite this little file urgently. genius.py is really clean though :3
Just wanted to get it to work.

https://cweiske.de/tagebuch/rhythmbox-lyrics.htm
Rythmbox, my music player doesn't support ID3 lyrics (USLT) yet, so I have to find something else
Lyrics in MP3 ID3 tags (SYLT/USLT) is still missing, because GStreamer does not support that yet.

One possible sollution would be to use ogg/vorbis files. Those lyrics are supported in rythmbox
'So, the next Rhythmbox release (3.5.0 or 3.4.2) will read lyrics directly from ogg/vorbis files, using the LYRICS and SYNCLYRICS tags.'
Another possible sollution (probaply the better one cuz I dont need to refactor whole metadata AGAIN)
would be to write a Rhythmbox plugin that fetches lyrics from ID3 USLT

I have written that Rhythmbox plugin: https://github.com/HeIIow2/rythmbox-id3-lyrics-support
