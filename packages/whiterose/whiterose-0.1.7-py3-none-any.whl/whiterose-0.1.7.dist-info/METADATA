## Examples

You can call the library by using this syntax:

```python
# This example will print the time to the console every second
from whiterose import Whiterose

wr = Whiterose()

def one_s_timer():
    wr.timer_s(1) # 1 second

if __name__ == '__main__':
    one_s_timer()
```

```python
# This example will print the time to the console every 4 seconds
from whiterose import Whiterose

wr = Whiterose()

def one_s_timer():
    wr.timer_s(4) # 4 seconds

if __name__ == '__main__':
    one_s_timer()
```

```python
# This example will print the time to the console every 2 minutes
from whiterose import Whiterose

wr = Whiterose()

def one_m_timer():
    wr.timer_m(2) # 2 minutes
