# quantms.io
[![Python application](https://github.com/bigbio/quantms.io/actions/workflows/python-app.yml/badge.svg?branch=dev)](https://github.com/bigbio/quantms.io/actions/workflows/python-app.yml)

[quantms](https://docs.quantms.org) is a nf-core pipeline for the analysis of quantitative proteomics data. The pipeline is based on the [OpenMS](https://www.openms.de/) framework and [DIA-NN](https://github.com/vdemichev/DiaNN); and it is designed to analyze large scale experiments. the main outputs of quantms tools are the following: 

- [mzTab](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzTab) files with the identification and quantification information.
- [MSstats](https://msstats.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MSstats_v3.7.3_manual.pdf) input file with the peptide quantification values needed for the MSstats analysis.
- [MSstats](https://msstats.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/MSstats_v3.7.3_manual.pdf) output file with the differential expression values for each protein. 
- The input [SDRF](https://github.com/bigbio/proteomics-sample-metadata) of the pipeline if available. 

Here, we aim to formalize and develop a more standardized format that enables better representation of the identification and quantification results but also enables new and novel use cases for proteomics data analysis: 

- Fast and easy visualization of the identification and quantification results.
- Easy integration with other omics data.
- Easy integration with sample metadata.
- AI/ML model development based on identification and quantification results.

**Note**: We are not trying to replace the mzTab format, but to provide a new format that enables AI-related use cases. Most of the features of the mzTab format will be included in the new format.  

## Data model

The GitHub repository aims to provide multiple formats for serialization of the data model, including:

- `Tab-delimited` format similar to mzTab. 
- `JSON` format to enable integration with other bioinformatics resources. 
- `Parquet` format to enable integration with big data frameworks and large-scale data integration.
