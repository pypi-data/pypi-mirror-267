  abstract = {There is a current interest in quantifying time-varying connectivity (TVC) based on neuroimaging data such as fMRI. Many methods have been proposed, and are being applied, revealing new insight into the brain’s dynamics. However, given that the ground truth for TVC in the brain is unknown, many concerns remain regarding the accuracy of proposed estimates. Since there exist many TVC methods it is difficult to assess differences in time-varying connectivity between studies. In this paper, we present tvc\_benchmarker, which is a Python package containing four simulations to test TVC methods. Here, we evaluate five different methods that together represent a wide spectrum of current approaches to estimating TVC (sliding window, tapered sliding window, multiplication of temporal derivatives, spatial distance and jackknife correlation). These simulations were designed to test each method’s ability to track changes in covariance over time, which is a key property in TVC analysis. We found that all tested methods correlated positively with each other, but there were large differences in the strength of the correlations between methods. To facilitate comparisons with future TVC methods, we propose that the described simulations can act as benchmark tests for evaluation of methods. Using tvc\_benchmarker researchers can easily add, compare and submit their own TVC methods to evaluate its performance.},

Therefore, it is not surprising that no common data generating process is available (i.e. several models can be found to model BOLD activation and noise). Based on a literature search, a database of simulation studies was compiled. The information in this database was analysed and critically evaluated focusing on the parameters in the simulation design, the adopted model to generate fMRI data, and on how the simulation studies are reported. Our literature analysis demonstrates that many fMRI simulation studies do not report a thorough experimental design and almost consistently ignore crucial knowledge on how fMRI data are acquired. Advice is provided on how the quality of fMRI simulation studies can be improved.},

Simulations of fMRI data can aid in both the evaluation of complex designs and the analysis of data. We present fmrisim, a new Python package for standardized, realistic simulation of fMRI data.

We valiyear the noise generated by fmrisim to show that it can approximate the noise properties of real data. We further show how fmrisim can help researchers find the optimal design in terms of power.

  abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) is a noninvasive method of imaging brain function in vivo. However, images produced in FMRI experiments are imperfect and contain several artifacts that contaminate the data. These artifacts include rigid-body motion effects, B0-field inhomogeneities, chemical shift, and eddy currents. To investigate these artifacts, with the eventual aim of minimizing or removing them completely, a computational model of the FMR image acquisition process was built that can simulate all of the above-mentioned artifacts. This paper gives an overview of the development of the FMRI simulator. The simulator uses the Bloch equations together with a geometric definition of the object (brain) and a varying T model for the BOLD activations. Furthermore, it simulates rigid-body motion of the object by solving Bloch equations for given motion parameters that are defined for an object moving continuously in time, including during the read-out period, which is a novel approach in the area of MRI computer simulations. With this approach it is possible, in a controlled and precise way, to simulate the full effects of various rigid-body motion artifacts in FMRI data (e.g. spin-history effects, B0-motion interaction, and within-scan motion blurring) and therefore formulate and test algorithms for their reduction.

SimTB captures the fundamental structure of real data, but data generation is fully parameterized and fully controlled by the user, allowing for accurate and precise comparisons. The toolbox offers a wealth of options regarding the number and configuration of spatial sources, implementation of experimental paradigms, inclusion of tissue-specific properties, addition of noise and head movement, and much more. A straightforward data generation method and short computation time (3–10 seconds for each dataset) allow a practitioner to simulate and analyze many datasets to potentially understand a problem from many angles. Beginning MATLAB users can use the SimTB graphical user interface (GUI) to design and execute simulations while experienced users can write batch scripts to automate and customize this process. The toolbox is freely available at http://mialab.mrn.org/software together with sample scripts and tutorials.},

The development was driven by the desire to achieve generality of simulated three-dimensional MRI experiments reflecting modern MRI systems hardware. The accompanying computational burden is overcome by means of parallel computing. Many aspects are covered that have not hitherto been simultaneously investigated in general MRI simulations such as parallel transmit and receive, important off-resonance effects, nonlinear gradients, and arbitrary spatiotemporal parameter variations at different levels. The latter can be used to simulate various types of motion, for instance. The JEMRIS user interface is very simple to use, but nevertheless it presents few limitations. MRI sequences with arbitrary waveforms and complex interdependent modules are modeled in a graphical user interface–based environment requiring no further programming. This manuscript describes the concepts, methods, and performance of the software. Examples of novel simulation results in active fields of MRI research are given.

The aim was to develop a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) simulator that makes no assumptions with respect to the underlying pulse sequence and also allows for complex large-scale analysis on a single computer without requiring simplifications of the MRI model. We hypothesized that such a simulation platform could be developed with parallel acceleration of the executable core within the graphic processing unit (GPU) environment. MRISIMUL integrates realistic aspects of the MRI experiment from signal generation to image formation and solves the entire complex problem for densely spaced isochromats and for a densely spaced time axis. The simulation platform was developed in MATLAB whereas the computationally demanding core services were developed in CUDA-C. The MRISIMUL simulator imaged three different computer models: a user-defined phantom, a human brain model and a human heart model. The high computational power of GPU-based simulations was compared against other computer configurations. A speedup of about 228 times was achieved when compared to serially executed C-code on the CPU whereas a speedup between 31 to 115 times was achieved when compared to the OpenMP parallel executed C-code on the CPU, depending on the number of threads used in multithreading (2–8 threads). The high performance of MRISIMUL allows its application in large-scale analysis and can bring the computational power of a supercomputer or a large computer cluster to a single GPU personal computer.},

Experiments and simulations were performed to demonstrate the usefulness of the MRI simulator for three types of pulse sequences, namely, three-dimensional (3D) gradient-echo, 3D radio-frequency spoiled gradient-echo, and gradient-echo multislice with practical matrix sizes. The results demonstrated that the calculation speed using two GPU boards was typically about 7 TFLOPS and about 14 times faster than the calculation speed using CPUs (two 18-core Xeons). We also found that MR images acquired by experiment could be reproduced using an appropriate number of subvoxels, and that 3D isotropic and two-dimensional multislice imaging experiments for practical matrix sizes could be simulated using the MRI simulator. Therefore, we concluded that such powerful MRI simulators are expected to become an indispensable tool for MRI research and development.},

However, even with the graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration, the heavy computational load remains a major challenge, especially in large-scale, highaccuracy simulation scenarios. This work aims to develop a deep learning-based simulator to accelerate Bloch simulation. Approach: The simulator model, called Simu-Net, is based on an end-to-end convolutional neural network and is trained with synthetic data generated by traditional Bloch simulation. It uses dynamic convolution to fuse spatial and physical information with different dimensions and introduces position encoding templates to achieve position-specific labeling and overcome the receptive field limitation of the convolutional network. Main Results: Compared with mainstream GPU-based MRI simulation software, Simu-Net successfully accelerates simulations by hundreds of times in both traditional and advanced MRI pulse sequences. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed framework were verified qualitatively and quantitatively. Besides, the trained Simu-Net was applied to generate sufficient customized training samples for deep learning-based T2 mapping and comparable results to conventional methods were obtained in the human brain. Significance: As a proof-of-concept work, Simu-Net shows the potential to apply deep learning for rapidly approximating the forward physical process of MRI and may increase the efficiency of Bloch simulation for optimization of MRI pulse sequences and deep learning-based methods.},

Commercial products that implement synthetic MRI are used in research. They rely on vendor-specific acquisitions and do not include the possibility of using custom multiparametric imaging techniques. We introduce PySynthMRI, an open-source tool with a user-friendly interface that uses a set of input images to generate synthetic images with diverse radiological contrasts by varying representative parameters of the desired target sequence, including the echo time, repetition time and inversion time(s). PySynthMRI is written in Python 3.6, and it can be executed under Linux, Windows, or MacOS as a python script or an executable. The tool is free and open source and is developed while taking into consideration the possibility of software customization by the end user. PySynthMRI generates synthetic images by calculating the pixelwise signal intensity as a function of a set of input images (e.g., T1 and T2 maps) and simulated scanner parameters chosen by the user via a graphical interface. The distribution provides a set of default synthetic contrasts, including T1w gradient echo, T2w spin echo, FLAIR and Double Inversion Recovery. The synthetic images can be exported in DICOM or NiFTI format. PySynthMRI allows for the fast synthetization of differently weighted MR images based on quantitative maps. Specialists can use the provided signal models to retrospectively generate contrasts and add custom ones.

During the sampling procedure changes in signal amplitude due to relaxation and excitation are introduced as well as signal phase changes due to movement or flow. Artifacts due to stimulated echoes and transversal magnetization that propagate through several repetition periods are also handled. The usefulness of the method is demonstrated by calculations using standard spin-echo sequence as well as modifications introduced in order to generate angiographical images and flow phase images. Further more a fast pulse sequence, echo planar imaging (EPI), is also simulated. The method is faster than previously presented ones. It is capable of generating images (128 × 128 matrix), including more than eight different T1 and T2 combinations, in less than 3 min on a standard 386387 type IBM compatible PC.},

  abstract = {Many informatics tools have emerged to process the voluminous and complex data generated by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The interpretation of fMRI exams is largely determined by these tools. However, their performance is hard to evaluate because there is no independent means of calibration. A novel fMRI calibration system called SmartPhantom has been developed to simulate functional blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) imaging. SmartPhantom contains a quadrature radio frequency coil, comprising two perpendicular planar loops that can be externally activated or deactivated. The system is able to produce reasonably uniform signal enhancements in a calibration sample surrounded by the two loops during an MRI scan. The enhancement is controlled well in both magnitude and predefined timing and produces BOLD-like signals. Characteristics of SmartPhantom are discussed in detail, followed by a comparison of fMRI informatics tools. Two fMRI data sets are acquired with the SmartPhantom. One with high signal-to-noise ratio provides the calibration. Another with lower SNR is input into three software packages (BrainVoyager, FSL and Statistical Parametric Mapping 2) for data preprocessing and statistical analysis. Results from the three packages are compared in both sensitivity of detecting the activation and correlation between the predicted activation and calibration.},

  abstract = {The fMRI community has made great strides in decoupling neuronal activity from other physiologically induced T2* changes, using sensors that provide a ground-truth with respect to cardiac, respiratory, and head movement dynamics. However, blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) time-series dynamics are also confounded by scanner artifacts, in complex ways that can vary not only between scanners but even, for the same scanner, between sessions. Unfortunately, the lack of an equivalent ground truth for BOLD time-series has thus far stymied the development of reliable methods for identification and removal of scanner-induced noise, a problem that we have previously shown to severely impact detection sensitivity of resting-state brain networks. To address this problem, we first designed and built a phantom capable of providing dynamic signals equivalent to that of the resting-state brain. Using the dynamic phantom, we then compared the ground-truth time-series with its measured fMRI data. Using these, we introduce data-quality metrics: Standardized Signal-to-Noise Ratio (ST-SNR) and Dynamic Fidelity that, unlike currently used measures such as temporal SNR (tSNR), can be directly compared across scanners. Dynamic phantom data acquired from four “best-case” scenarios: high-performance scanners with MR-physicist-optimized acquisition protocols, still showed scanner instability/multiplicative noise contributions of about 6–18\% of the total noise. We further measured strong non-linearity in the fMRI response for all scanners, ranging between 8–19\% of total voxels. To correct scanner distortion of fMRI time-series dynamics at a single-subject level, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) on paired sets of measured vs. ground-truth data. The CNN learned the unique features of each session's noise, providing a customized temporal filter. Tests on dynamic phantom time-series showed a 4- to 7-fold increase in ST-SNR and about 40–70\% increase in Dynamic Fidelity after denoising, with CNN denoising outperforming both the temporal bandpass filtering and denoising using Marchenko-Pastur principal component analysis. Critically, we observed that the CNN temporal denoising pushes ST-SNR to a regime where signal power is higher than that of noise (ST-SNR {$>$} 1). Denoising human-data with ground-truth-trained CNN, in turn, showed markedly increased detection sensitivity of resting-state networks. These were visible even at the level of the single-subject, as required for clinical applications of fMRI.},

  abstract = {This paper concerns the problem of correcting spin-history artefacts in fMRI data. We focus on the influence of through-plane motion on the history of magnetization. A change in object position will disrupt the tissue’s steady-state magnetization. The disruption will propagate to the next few acquired volumes until a new steady state is reached. In this paper we present a simulation of spin-history effects, experimental data, and an automatic two-step algorithm for detecting and correcting spin-history artefacts. The algorithm determines the steady-state distribution of all voxels in a given slice and indicates which voxels need a spin-history correction. The spin-history correction is meant to be applied before standard realignment procedures. To obtain experimental data a special phantom and an MRI compatible motion system were designed. The effect of motion on spin-history is presented for data obtained using this phantom inside a 1.5-T MRI scanner. We show that the presented algorithm is capable of detecting the occurrence of a displacement, and it determines which voxels need a spin-history correction. The results of the phantom study show good agreement with the simulations.},

  abstract = {Obtaining functional magnetic resonance images of the brain is a challenging measurement process having a low characteristic signal-to-noise ratio. Images contain various forms of noise, including those induced by physiologic processes. One of the prevalent disturbances is hypothesized to result from susceptibility fluctuations caused by abdominal volume changes during respiration. To test this hypothesis and characterize the contribution of respiration noise to both magnitude and phase images, a mechanical model of a respiring human was constructed. The model was tested by comparing data from the model with that of a resting human. Power spectrum analyses show that the model induces both phase and magnitude disturbances similar to those in the human. The disturbances are directly related to the frequency of the respiration, with the noise most prevalent in the phase images. Though magnitude image noise is hard to identify in the human, the manikin demonstrates the presence of this disturbance. The construction of the manikin rules out motion as the primary source of the observed fluctuations and variation of the electrical properties of the manikin also indicates that signal fluctuations are not primarily due to eddy currents. Therefore, the changes are most probably induced by bulk susceptibility changes correlating with respiration.},

  abstract = {Blood oxygen-level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI) has rapidly become a popular technique for the investigation of brain function in healthy individuals, patients as well as in animal studies. However, the BOLD signal arises from a complex mixture of neuronal, metabolic and vascular processes, being therefore an indirect measure of neuronal activity, which is further severely corrupted by multiple non-neuronal fluctuations of instrumental, physiological or subject-specific origin. This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of existing methods for cleaning the BOLD fMRI signal. The description is given from a methodological point of view, focusing on the operation of the different techniques in addition to pointing out the advantages and limitations in their application. Since motion-related and physiological noise fluctuations are two of the main noise components of the signal, techniques targeting their removal are primarily addressed, including both data-driven approaches and using external recordings. Data-driven approaches, which are less specific in the assumed model and can simultaneously reduce multiple noise fluctuations, are mainly based on data decomposition techniques such as principal and independent component analysis. Importantly, the usefulness of strategies that benefit from the information available in the phase component of the signal, or in multiple signal echoes is also highlighted. The use of global signal regression for denoising is also addressed. Finally, practical recommendations regarding the optimization of the preprocessing pipeline for the purpose of denoising and future venues of research are indicated. Through the review, we summarize the importance of signal denoising as an essential step in the analysis pipeline of task-based and resting state fMRI studies.},

  abstract = {Purpose MR imaging and spectroscopy require a highly stable, uniform background field. The field stability is typically limited by hardware imperfections, external perturbations, or field fluctuations of physiological origin. The purpose of the present work is to address these issues by introducing spatiotemporal field stabilization based on real-time sensing and feedback control. Methods An array of NMR field probes is used to sense the field evolution in a whole-body MR system concurrently with regular system operation. The field observations serve as inputs to a proportional-integral controller that governs correction currents in gradient and higher-order shim coils such as to keep the field stable in a volume of interest. Results The feedback system was successfully set up, currently reaching a minimum latency of 20 ms. Its utility is first demonstrated by countering thermal field drift during an EPI protocol. It is then used to address respiratory field fluctuations in a T2*-weighted brain exam, resulting in substantially improved image quality. Conclusion Feedback field control is an effective means of eliminating dynamic field distortions in MR systems. Third-order spatial control at an upyear time of 100 ms has proven sufficient to largely eliminate thermal and breathing effects in brain imaging at 7 Tesla.

  abstract = {This work investigates the role of magnetic field fluctuations as a confound in fMRI. In standard fMRI experiments with single-shot EPI acquisition at 3 Tesla the uniform and gradient components of the magnetic field were recorded with NMR field sensors. By principal component analysis it is found that differences of field evolution between the EPI readouts are explainable by few components relating to slow and within-shot field dynamics of hardware and physiological origin. The impact of fluctuating field components is studied by selective data correction and assessment of its influence on image fluctuation and SFNR. Physiological field fluctuations, attributed to breathing, were found to be small relative to those of hardware origin. The dominant confounds were hardware-related and attributable to magnet drift and thermal changes. In raw image time series, field fluctuation caused significant SFNR loss, reflected by a 67\% gain upon correction. Large part of this correction can be accomplished by traditional image realignment, which addresses slow and spatially uniform field changes. With realignment, explicit field correction increased the SFNR on the order of 6\%. In conclusion, field fluctuations are a relevant confound in fMRI and can be addressed effectively by retrospective data correction. Based on the physics involved it is anticipated that the advantage of full field correction increases with field strength, with non-Cartesian readouts, and upon phase-sensitive BOLD analysis.},
