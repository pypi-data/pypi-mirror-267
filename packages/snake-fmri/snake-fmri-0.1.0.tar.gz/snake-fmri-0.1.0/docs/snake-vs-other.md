# Comparison with other Simulators
The complexity of fMRI data poses challenges in creating a common data-generating process. A comprehensive review of fMRI simulation studies, as noted in Welvaert et al. {cite}`welvaert_review_2014`, revealed that the absence of a standardized data generation approach hampers progress. The review emphasized the need for improved experimental design reporting and a deeper understanding of fMRI data acquisition processes. The current landscape of fMRI simulation software mainly consists of

## fMRI Simulators

### fMRISim / NeuroRSim

Among existing fMRI simulation tools, several offer distinct advantages and limitations. 
fMRIsim presented by Ellis et al. {cite}`ellis_facilitating_2020`, is a Python package that enables standardized and realistic fMRI data simulation. 
It assists in evaluating complex experimental designs and optimizing statistical power. 
However, it mainly focuses on single-subject simulations and requires manual parameter setting or estimation from real data. 
It was inspired by a parent R package neuroRsim {cite}`welvaert_neurosim_2011`. 
Nevertheless, it primarily deals with magnitude data in additive settings, which might restrict its applicability for specific simulations.

### POSSUM 

The POSSUM simulator, as outlined by Drobnjak et al. {cite}`drobnjak_development_2006`, offers a comprehensive approach by modeling various artifacts encountered in fMRI experiments. 
POSSUM accurately simulates these artifacts using Bloch equations and a geometric definition of the brain. 
However, it has a computational cost, lengthy simulation times, and limited trajectory options.

### SimTB

SimTB, introduced by Erhardt et al. {cite}`erhardt_simtb_2012`, is a MATLAB toolbox specializing in simulating fMRI datasets under a model of spatiotemporal separability. 
It offers extensive customization options, including spatial sources, experimental paradigms, tissue-specific properties, noise, and head movement. 
SimTB is equipped with both a graphical user interface and scripting capabilities.
