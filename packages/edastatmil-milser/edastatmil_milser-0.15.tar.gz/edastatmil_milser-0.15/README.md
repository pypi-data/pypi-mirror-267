## General Description  
This library provides useful tools for performing a complete EDA.

> **⚠️ Note:** This module is in development and may contain errors.

> **⚠️ Note:** Some functions only apply to very general cases. To perform a good EDA, it is necessary to understand the specific case being worked on, and in many cases, actions that are not covered in this module will be needed.

> **⚠️ Note:** Please read the function descriptions carefully, as some require a specific file system. The final file structure if the EDA is done with edastatmil-milser is shown in the following figure:

## Functions
### `get_column_type(series)`

This function studies whether a feature is numerical or categorical.

- **Usage example:**
  ```python
  variables = pd.DataFrame({'Data Type': data_frame.dtypes})
  variables['Data category'] = df.apply(EDA.get_column_type)

Adds a new column to the 'variables' dataframe called 'Data type' indicating whether the variable is categorical or numerical.
- **Return:**
   'Categorical' if the variable is categorical, 'Numerical' if it is numerical.

### `explore(data_frame)`

This function gives a general idea of the dataframe's content.

- **Usage example:**
  ```python
  categorical_list, numerical_list = EDA.explore(df_example)

Displays the number of columns and rows and a table with information about non-null, null values, data type, and category of the variables.

- **Return:**
   List of categorical variables and list of numerical variables.

### `FindDuplicates(data_frame, id_col, Drop=False)`

In the first one, age is represented on the x-axis, with one bar for each value of the smoker column, and the bar height represents the mean of the 'charges' variable for each group. In the second plot, age is represented on the x-axis, with one bar for each value of the 'children' column, and the bar height represents the mean of 'charges' for each group.

### `outliers_iqr(df,var,sigma,Do='nothing')`

This function searches for outliers in the indicated column, using the interquartile range criterion (75%-25%). It adjusts the upper and lower limits of the accepted value range with a sigma parameter. There are different options for handling the found outliers.
> **⚠️ Note:** This function is not the only way to handle outliers, and for specific cases not covered here, manual intervention may be necessary.

> **⚠️ Note:** This function will attempt to handle ALL outliers in the same column as indicated.

- **Attributes:** 
   - df: the name of the dataframe to be explored.
   - var: the variable on which outliers are to be searched.
   - sigma: the parameter for adjusting the accepted value range.
   - Do: what to do with the outliers. If 'nothing', it counts them but does nothing. If 'mode', 'median', or 'mean', it replaces them with the mode, median, or mean respectively. If 'drop', it removes the rows with the outliers from the dataframe. 

- **Usage example:**
  ```python
  outliers, cleaned_df = EDA.outliers_iqr(raw_df,'bmi',1,Do='drop')
In this case, cleaned_df will not have the outlier rows because 'drop' option is chosen.
- **Return:**
  Returns a dataframe with the outliers and another dataframe with the outliers treated according to the chosen method. In any case, it will print the number of outliers found.

### `splitter(origin_root,predictors,target)`

This function splits all dataframes found in the indicated path into train and test sets.
> **⚠️ Note:** Make sure that only the dataframes to be split are in the indicated path. The rest should be saved in another folder.

> **⚠️ Note:** Make sure to name the initial files properly so that you can later differentiate all resulting files from the split.

- **Attributes:** 
   - origin_root: the path where the dataframes to be split are located, including / at the end.
   - predictors: list of predictor variables.
   - target: name of the target variable. 

- **Usage example:**
  ```python
  predictors = ['age', 'sex', 'bmi', 'children', 'smoker', 'region']
  target = 'charges'
  EDA.splitter('../data/processed/',predictors,target)
All dataframes saved in the path '../data/processed/' will be split into train and test sets.
- **Return:**
  Creates a folder in the indicated path named SplitData. Inside, you will find all resulting dataframes from the split of each file. To the original file names, the suffixes _Xtrain, _Xtest, _ytrain, _ytest will be added to differentiate them.

### `normalize(origin_root,predictors,scaler='StandardScaler')`

This function normalizes the data of the predictor variables.
> **⚠️ Note:** Remember that the target variable is not normalized.

> **⚠️ Note:** Before using this function, categorical variables must be factorized.

- **Attributes:** 
   - origin_root: the path where the dataframes to be normalized are located, including / at the end.
   - predictors: list of predictor variables.
   - scaler: name of the scaling function to be used. It can be any from the sklearn.preprocessing library. Default is StandardScaler.

- **Usage example:**

  EDA.normalize('../data/processed/SplitData/',predictors,scaler_='StandardScaler')
Predictor variables of all dataframes located in the directory '../data/processed/SplitData/' and containing the suffixes _Xtrain,_Xtest in their file names will be normalized.
- **Return:**
  Creates a folder in the indicated path named NormData. Inside, you will find all resulting dataframes from the normalization of each dataframe. To the original file names, the suffix _norm will be added.

### `feature_sel(X_train,y_train,k,file_name,method='SelectKBest', test='mutual_info_classif')`

This function performs feature selection on the training datasets, leaving a number k of variables and using the specified method and test.
> **⚠️ Note:** Remember that feature selection is not performed on the test data.

- **Attributes:** 
   - X_train: the dataframe containing the training data of the predictors.
   - y_train: the dataframe containing the training data of the target.
   - k: the number of variables to keep.
   - file_name: the name with which to save the resulting dataframe after feature selection.
   - method: the method to use for feature selection.
   - test: the test based on which feature selection is to be performed.

- **Usage example:**

  All_X_train = pd.read_csv('../data/processed/SplitData/NormData/All_factorize_Xtrain_norm.csv')
  All_y_train = pd.read_csv('../data/processed/SplitData/All_factorize_ytrain.csv')    
  EDA.feature_sel(All_X_train,All_y_train,k_=4,file_name='All_Xtrain', method_='SelectKBest', test_='mutual_info_regression')
Normalized dataframes can be loaded from wherever they were saved.
A training dataframe will be created containing only the most relevant columns according to the specified method and test.

  Creates a folder in the SplitData folder, named FeatureSel, and saves the dataset with only the selected columns with the indicated name and the suffix _FeatureSel.

Version 1.0 (07/04/2024)

When you want to increment the version number for a new release use [`bumpversion`](https://github.com/peritus/bumpversion) to do it correctly across the whole library.
For example, to increment to a new patch release you would simply run

```
bumpversion patch
```

which given the [`.bumpversion.cfg`](https://github.com/milser/Python-library-template/blob/master/.bumpversion.cfg) makes a new commit that increments the release version by one patch release.
