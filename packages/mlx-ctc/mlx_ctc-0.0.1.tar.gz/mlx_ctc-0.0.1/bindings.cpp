        The Connectionist Temporal Classification loss

        Calculates loss between a continuous (unsegmented) time series and a target sequence. CTCLoss sums over the
        probability of possible alignments of input to target, producing a loss value which is differentiable
        with respect to each input node. The alignment of input to target is assumed to be "many-to-one", which
        limits the length of the target sequence such that it must be <= the input length.

        Args:
            log_probs (array):
                The logarithmized probabilities of the outputs (e.g. obtained with `mlx::core::log_softmax`)
                of size `(T, N, C)`, where
                `T = input length`, `N = batch size`, and
                `C = number of classes` (including blank)

            targets (array):
                Target sequences of size `(N, S)`, where
                `N = batch size` and `S = max target length`.
                Each element in the target sequence is a class index.
                Target index cannot be blank (default=0).
                Targets are padded to the length of the longest sequence, and stacked.

            input_lengths (array):
                Lengths of the inputs of size `(N)`, where `N = batch size` (must each be <= `T`).
                Lengths are specified for each sequence to achieve masking under the assumption that
                sequences are padded to equal lengths.

            input_lengths (array):
                Lengths of the targets of size `(N)`, where `N = batch size` (must each be <= `S`).
                Lengths are specified for each sequence to achieve masking under the assumption that
                sequences are padded to equal lengths.

            blank (int):
                blank label. Default `0`.

        Returns:
            array: `(N)`, where `N = batch size`
        )"
