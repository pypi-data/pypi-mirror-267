    The Inspector takes a dictionary of rules 
    and applies them to the trajectories of 
    a `Targets` type dictionary passed to it.
    
    The dict passed to the inspector
    is expected to have the following structure:
        dict[MMSI,TargetVessel]
    and will most likely be the output of the
    :meth:`SearchAgent.get_all_ships()` method.
    
    For how to create a recipe, see the 
    :mod:`pytsa.trajectories.rules` module.

    """
    Calculate the average smoothness of a navigational 
    track.

    This function computes the average smoothness of a 
    path represented  by a list of AISMessage objects.  
    It evaluates the smoothness based on the angles 
    formed at each point along the path, where each 
    angle is determined by a sequence of three consecutive 
    AISMessage points. The smoothness is a measure of 
    how straight or curved the path is, with larger 
    angles indicating a smoother path.

    The angle at each point is normalized by dividing it 
    by π, with the function 'angle_between' used to 
    calculate these angles. Since 'angle_between' returns 
    values from 0 to π, the normalized angles will range 
    from 0 (representing a U-turn)  to 1 (representing a 
    straight line).

    Parameters:
    - track (Track): A list of AISMessage objects 
      representing the navigational path. Each AISMessage 
      contains positional data necessary for angle calculation.

    Returns:
    - float: The average smoothness of the track, 
      represented as a float. This value is the mean 
      of the normalized angles along the track, where 
      a larger values indicates a smoother track.

    Note:
    - The function assumes that the track has at least three 
       AISMessage points to form at least one angle. If the 
       track has fewer than three points, the behavior of the 
       function is unspecified.
