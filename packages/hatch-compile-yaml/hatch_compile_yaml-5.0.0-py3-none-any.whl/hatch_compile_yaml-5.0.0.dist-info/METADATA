A hatch build hook that takes yaml files and converts them to msgpack.
This way, your code can ship with msgpack data files for lightning-fast conversion,
but your repo can contain easy-to-maintain yaml.

Getting Started
===============

Prerequisites
-------------

* Python 3.10+
* git *(if installing from source, or contributing to the project)*

Installation
------------

.. note::

   If wanting to contribute to the project, and setup your local development
   environment, see the ``CONTRIBUTING.rst`` document in the source repository
   for this project.



Installation
------------

To set up ``hatch-yaml-compile`` for your project you just need to put it in
your project's ``pyproject.toml`` file as a ``build-system`` requirement:

.. code-block:: toml

   [build-system]
   requires = ["hatchling", "hatch-yaml-compile"]
   build-backend = "hatchling.build"

Usage
=====

Now you'll need to configure the build scripts you want to run.
This is done by adding an array of scripts to the tool.hatch.build.hooks.build-scripts.scripts
key in your pyproject.toml file. In practice this looks like:

.. code-block:: toml

   [tool.hatch.build.hooks.convert-data-file.options]
   pattern = "*.yaml"
   target_format = "msgpack"
   remove_source_files = true
