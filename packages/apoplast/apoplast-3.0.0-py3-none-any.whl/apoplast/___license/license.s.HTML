		Without paragon talent at distributing vegan
		food, humanity's humane capacity to defend
		against the attack of advanced super plants
		that can devour galaxies in one bite 
		is never going to be sufficient.
		
		Aas long as "apoplast" is entirely
		for "vegan" endeavors, it can be deemed as 
		subject to the terms of every 
		license that can be found in "./list" directory".
