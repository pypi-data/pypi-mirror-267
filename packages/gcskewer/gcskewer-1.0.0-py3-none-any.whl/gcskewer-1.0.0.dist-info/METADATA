# gcskewer
create GC skew plots from DNA sequences in python

## Installation
The easiest way to install gcskewer is though the python package index.

`pip install gcskewer`

This will fetch and install the latest version from: LINK

You can also install `gcskewer` by cloning this repository.

`gcskewer` requires `Bio`,`matplotlib` and `plotly`. They should be installed automatically.


## Usage
### Input
`gcskewer` can take DNA sequences in .fasta or .gbk format. You can specify with `-f`/`--fasta` or `-g`/`--gbk`. You can't do both at the same time - only define you sequence one! For example:

`gcskewer -g example.gbk`

**or**

`gcskewer -f example.fasta`

### Output
`gcskewer` has three output formats: .csv (a comma seperated table of the results), .svg (an editable vector format graph) and .html (an interactive graph of the results). You can specify which outputs you want with `-c`/`--csv`, `-s`/`--svg` and `-p`/`--plot` (for the .html). If you are unsure, you can just specify all three:

`gcskewer -g example.gbk -c -s -p`

### Window and Step Size
`gcskewer` will automatically decide the window and step size for the analysis, however you can set these values yourself. For best results, I recommend using a step size that will result in around 1,000 steps. E.g. for a sequence of 50 kb use a step size of 50. Ensure that the window size is **at least** the same size as the step. You can set the window and step size with `-ws`/`--window-size` and `-ss`/`--step-size`, respectively. For example:

`gcskewer -g example.gbk -ss 50 -ws 500`

## Example Data
Example data and output is provided in the `example_data` directory in this repository. There are two subdirectories `fasta` and `genbank` to illustrate how `gcskewer` operates on different input types. Each directry contains the .csv, .svg and .html output and the command used to generate then data is stored as `command.bash`.

This script was origionally inspired by Nivina et al.'s paper: [GRINS: Genetic elements that recode assembly-line polyketide synthases and accelerate their diversification](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2100751118). As such, I used the polyketide synthase tylactone as a test case. The sequence was obtained from [MiBiG](https://mibig.secondarymetabolites.org/repository/BGC0001812/index.html#r1c1).
