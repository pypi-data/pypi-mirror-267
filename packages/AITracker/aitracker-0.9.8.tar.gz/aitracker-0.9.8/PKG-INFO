# AITracker

## What is this?

AITracker is a deep learning neural network designed to take an image of a person's eyes and determine the direction they are looking in. This repo is a Python module designed to be as easy to use as possible.

## Note

This module requires the `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat` file used in dlib, which can be found at this [link](https://github.com/tzutalin/dlib-android/blob/master/data/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat).

## How to use

Simply install using the command:

`pip3 install aitracker`
