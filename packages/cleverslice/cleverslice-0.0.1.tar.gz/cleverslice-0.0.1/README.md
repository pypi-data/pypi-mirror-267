`cleverslice` is a Python library that enhances dictionary usage by introducing slicing capabilities similar to tuples and lists, without compromising the dictionary's inherent functionalities. This makes it easier to work with dictionary subsets, improving the flexibility and efficiency of dictionary operations in Python applications.

## Features

- **Slicing**: Perform slicing operations on dictionaries similar to tuples and lists.
- **Compatibility**: Fully compatible with standard dictionary operations.
- **Ease of Use**: Intuitive syntax that fits seamlessly into existing Python codebases.

## Installation

To install `cleverslice`, simply use pip:

```bash
pip install cleverslice
```

## Usage

Here is a quick example to get you started with `cleverslice`:

```python
from cleverslice import sdict

my_dict = sdict({'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4, 'e': 5})


```

In this example, we first create a `cleverslice` object from a standard dictionary. We then perform a slicing operation to obtain a subset of the dictionary. The `cleverslice` object still supports all standard dictionary operations.
