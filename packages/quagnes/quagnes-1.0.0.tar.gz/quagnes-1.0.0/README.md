# Summary
This package solves Agnes (Agnes Sorel) solitaire card games. It can
be used to solve games having the rules implemented in the GNOME AisleRiot
package and the rules attributed to Dalton in 1909 (with a minor variant
in the table layout) and Parlett in 1979 among others [1â€“3] and to
calculate win rates.

# Example
```
import random
import quagnes

random.seed(12345)
n_reps = 1000

attributes = ['n_states_checked', 'n_deal', 'n_move_to_foundation',
      'n_move_card_in_tableau','n_no_move_possible','max_score','max_depth',
      'current_depth']

# header for the output file
print('rc,' + ','.join(attributes))

for rep in range(0, n_reps):
    new_game=quagnes.Agnes()
    rc = new_game.play()

    # Write the return code and selected attributes from the game
    out_str = (str(rc) + ',' +
        ','.join([ str(getattr(new_game, attr)) for attr in attributes ]))
    print(out_str, flush=True)

    # rc==1 are games that were won, but probably best to only print a
    # limited number for debugging or for rule variants when
    # win rate is low

    #if rc==1:
    #    f = open(f'winners/win{rep}.txt', 'w', encoding='utf-8')
    #    fwrite(new_game.print_history())
    #    f.close()
```

# Release Notes
## Version 1.0.0
- Change name of `split_same_suit_runs` parameter to `split_runs` and make
  parameter applicable regardless of the value of `move_same_suit`.
- Add optimization for use when the losing state set is disabled.
Track for each pile the last move depth, the number of cards
moved, whether the pile was moved from or to, and whether the bottom card
in the moved pile could be played to the foundation at the time of the move.
Do not allow moves that: (a) reverse a previous tableau move without an
intervening move to foundation or deal; (b) make the last deal after a
tableau move where neither pile is dealt to and neither file had a card
played to foundation; (c) play the bottom card of the moved pile to the
foundation after the tableau move if it could have been played at the time
of the move (and there has been no subsequent move to the pile or deal
onto the pile).  These optimizations are only employed when the losing
states set is
disabled, as they use information not stored in the losing states set to
determine whether a move can be played.
- Add optimization when moves to empty piles allow zero or multiple cards
to reduce the space of moves to consider when the stock is empty or near
empty (without
changing the win possibility or maximum score that can be attained). In
these rules, we use the term 'top card' to describe the highest-rank card
in the pile being moved and 'same-color top card' to be the card with equal
rank in the same-color suit. The rules are: (a) when moving runs by suit,
never split a run between same-suit cards when the stock is empty;
(b) never split a run between same-suit cards when neither pile can be
covered by a future deal and the same-color top card is in the foundation;
(c) when the stock is empty, force a move onto a card of the same suit
where possible when we know the target pile cannot be needed to move the
same-color top card (ie, the same-color top card is already in the
foundation or in same-suit sequence or the card one rank higher than the
same-color top card is already exposed at the bottom of a pile); (d) when
the stock is empty, force a move to the foundation if the card being
moved cannot be needed as a target to be moved onto (ie, if the card in the
same-color suit that is one rank lower is already in the foundation or in
same-suit sequence).
- Add new attributes created for these two optimizations in `_AgnesState` class (`in_suit_seq`, `last_in_pile`,
  `_all_lmi`) and to output printed when state is printed.
- Add `_AgnesState.hash_str` attribute to store the string representing
  the hash of the object that will be stored in the losing states and
  check loop set. Add `_Agnes_state.update_hash_str()` function called
  after move is performed or undone to save the string in `hash_str`.
  Previously, the `hash_str` was recalculated multiple times.
- Fix bug in `Agnes.print_history` as only half the history was being
  printed.
- Use a single set to track whether loop has occured rather than a stack of
  sets. Save result of check whether state is in the losing states set
  so that we do not inefficiently (re-)insert the state into the losing
  states set. Add attributes `is_loop` and `is_loser` to `_AgnesState`
  class to support this logic.
- Created for C++ implementation. Move detailed information
  on the background, game rules, program methodology, and analysis of
  win rates to that repository from this README. Add win rates
  for rule variants where the empty rule is *AnyRun* or *HighRun*.

# External Documentation
A C++ implementation written by this package author also exists in a git
repository.  Detailed information on the background, game rules, program
methodology, and analysis of win rates are available [there](https://github.com/ghrgriner/quagnes-cpp/wiki/Rules,-Methodology,-and-Analysis-of-Win-Rates).

# Using the Package
Games are simulated by creating an `Agnes` object with the appropriate
parameters, running `Agnes.play()`, and then using the return code and
extracting desired statistics from `Agnes` class attributes.

## Input Parameters
The following are the parameters used to construct `Agnes` objects:

|Parameter | Type | Description |
|:-------- | :----- | :---------  |
|`deck_filename` | `str` | Read deck from text file. If empty, a random deck will be used by calling `random.shuffle` and reversing the results. The text file should consist of 52 lines with each line formatted as `(rank, suit)`, where rank is in {0, 1, ..., 12} and suit is in {0, 1, 2, 3}. Suits are the same color if their value is equal modulus 2. The first card dealt is the base card.|
|`move_to_empty_pile`| `str` | Rule for what can be moved to empty tableau piles. See following table for valid values.|
|`move_same_suit`| `boolean` | If True, move runs by suit. If False (default), move runs by color.|
|`split_runs` | `boolean` | If True, movable runs must be moved in their entirety. If False (default), a movable run can be split for a move).|
|`face_up`| `boolean` |  If True, deal all cards face-up in the tableau. If False (default), only the last card in each column. |
|`track_threshold`| `int` | If the number of cards left in the stock is greater than or equal to this value (default = 0), track losing states in a single set for the whole game. This set can consume a lot of memory if some of the other options are chosen that allow a large number of moves (eg, `move_to_empty_pile != 'none'`).|
| `print_states` | `boolean` | Print detailed information about each state as moves are performed and undone. |
| `maximize_score` | `boolean` | Maximize score. Disable optimization that inspects the layout of highest-ranked cards in the tableau to determine if game is unwinnable. |
| `max_states` | `int` | Terminate game with return code 3 when number of states examined exceeds this threshold. 0 (default) means no threshold is used.|

### Rule for Moving to Empty Piles
|Value of `move_to_empty_pile` | Description |
|:-------- | :---------  |
|`'none'` | Empty piles can only be filled when dealing from stock (default). |
|`'any run'` | Empty piles can be filled by any movable card or movable run. |
|`'high run'` | Empty piles can be filled by any movable highest-rank card or movable run starting with a highest-rank card. |
|`'any 1'` | Empty piles can be filled by any movable single card, but not by a movable run of more than one card. |
|`'high 1'` | Empty piles can be filled by a single movable highest-rank card, but not by a movable run of more than one card. |

## Output
### `Agnes.play()` Return Code and `Agnes` Attributes
The return code of the `Agnes.play()` function indicates whether the game is
winnable (return code = 1), not winnable (return code = 2), or the
simulation was terminated due to reaching the maximum number of states
specified by the `max_states` parameter (return code = 3). The `Agnes`
object has attributes with the same name and type as the input parameters
that store the values of the parameters used during object construction.
In addition, the following attributes of `Agnes` are updated when
`Agnes.play()` is executed:

| Attribute | Description |
| :------------   | :---------  |
| `n_states_checked` | Count number of states checked (including repeats). |
| `n_deal` | Count number of deals performed (including those undone). |
| `n_foundation` | Count number of moves to foundation performed (including those undone). |
| `n_move_card_in_tableau` | Count number of moves in tableau performed (including those undone). |
| `max_score` | Maximum score found during play. (If moving to empty piles is not allowed, this will not be the true maximum, unless `-z` was specified to disable the optimization that tries to detect unwinnable games from the location of the highest-rank cards in the tableau.) |
| `max_depth` | Maximum depth of the search tree of moves. |
| `current_depth` | Depth of the search tree when the game was terminated. This value is always 0 for losing games. |

### Detailed Program Output
When `print_states=True` for the `Agnes` object, `Agnes.play()` will print
to standard output each state as moves are performed or undone.
