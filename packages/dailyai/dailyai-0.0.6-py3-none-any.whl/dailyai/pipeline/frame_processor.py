    """This is the base class for all frame processors. Frame processors consume a frame
    and yield 0 or more frames. Generally frame processors are used as part of a pipeline
    where frames come from a source queue, are processed by a series of frame processors,
    then placed on a sink queue.

    By convention, FrameProcessors should immediately yield any frames they don't process.

    Stateful FrameProcessors should watch for the EndFrame and finalize their
    output, eg. yielding an unfinished sentence if they're aggregating LLM output to full
    sentences. EndFrame is also a chance to clean up any services that need to
    be closed, del'd, etc.
