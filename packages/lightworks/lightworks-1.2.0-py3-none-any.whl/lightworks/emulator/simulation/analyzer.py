    The analyzer class is built as an alternative to simulation, intended for
    cases where we want to look at the transformations between a specific 
    subset of states. It is useful for the simulation of probabilities in 
    cases where loss and circuit errors are likely to be a factor. As part of
    the process a performance and error rate metric are calculated.

        performance : The total probabilities of mapping between the states 
            provided compared with all possible states.
                      
        error_rate : Given an expected mapping, the analyzer will determine the
            extent to which this is achieved.
