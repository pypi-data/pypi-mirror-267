# Snake Environment

The Snake Environment is a Python package designed for training machine learning models using reinforcement learning techniques. This environment mimics the OpenAI Gym interface, providing a familiar setup for those who are accustomed to using Gym for developing and testing AI models.

## Features

- **Game Environment**: Built using Pygame, this environment allows for on-screen rendering of the snake game, which is useful for visual feedback while training models.
- **Compatibility with AI Training Workflows**: The `SnakeGame` class features a `step` function that returns a tuple of (done, reward, score, state), similar to environments found in OpenAI Gym.
- **State Representation**: The state is represented as a numpy array with 18 dimensions, providing comprehensive information about the game environment at any given step.
- **Utility Methods**: Includes `reset` and `state_dimensions` methods for resetting the game state and retrieving the dimensions of the state space, respectively.

## Installation

To install the Snake Environment, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install snake_environment
```

## Usage
```python
from snake_environment import SnakeGame

# Initialize the environment
env = SnakeGame(render=True)  # Set render=False if you do not need to visualize the training process

# Start a new episode
state = env.reset()

# Loop until the episode is finished
done = False
while not done:
    action = model.predict(state)  # Replace this with your model's prediction method
    next_state, done, reward, score = env.step(action)
    state = next_state

# Get the dimensions of the state for input layer configuration or debugging
state_dim = env.state_dimensions
print("State dimensions:", state_dim)

```
