But why `Cousteau`_? The RIPE Atlas team decided to name all of its
modules after explorers, and this is not an exception :)

Releases History
================

2.0.0 (release 2023-01-20)
--------------------------
Changes:
~~~~~~~~
- The AtlasStream class has been updated to use the new WebSocket interface
- AtlasStream objects can now be iterated as an alternative to using callbacks
- There used to be both start_stream() and subscribe() methods which did the same thing,
  except that start_stream() had extra validation. This extra validation has been
  added to subscribe(), and start_stream() is now an alias to it.
- bind_channel() was renamed to bind(), although it is maintained as an alias, and
  there is a corresponding unbind() to remove a callback
- Deprecated event aliases were dropped, you have to use full event names like
  "atlas_result" and "atlas_metadata" when binding
