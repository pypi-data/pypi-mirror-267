## Origins

The development of this project stemmed from our experience using Laravel for project development. However, due to limitations in PHP's underlying structure, such as issues with multithreading and low-level code, we encountered some problems that were difficult to resolve. As a result, we decided to switch to Python for development. However, we found that most Python frameworks' usage patterns were relatively outdated and lacked the elegance of Laravel. Therefore, we embarked on developing the Avania framework to address these issues.

## Project Components
