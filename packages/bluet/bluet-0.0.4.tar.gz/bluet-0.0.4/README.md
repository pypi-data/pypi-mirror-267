# bluet

A *unit-test* library and setup for embedded bluetooth testing.

It expects a bluetooth application to be cross-compiled into an executable in a PC to run, and it should only include the bluetooth host but not the controller.
The test framework will use [bumble](https://github.com/google/bumble) to setup everything else so the test code interacts with a python-based device.
