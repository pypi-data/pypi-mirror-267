            Parameters
            ----------
                matrix : ndarray
                    Decision matrix / alternatives data.
                    Alternatives are in rows and Criteria are in columns.

                weights : ndarray
                    Criteria weights. Sum of the weights should be 1. (e.g. sum(weights) == 1)

                types : ndarray
                    Array with definitions of criteria types:
                    1 if criteria is profit and -1 if criteria is cost for each criteria in `matrix`.

                *args: is necessary for methods which reqiure some additional data.

                **kwargs: is necessary for methods which reqiure some additional data.

            Returns
            -------
                ndarray
                    Preference values for alternatives. Better alternatives have higher values.
