# BRO
This package can access the REST API from the [BRO](https://www.broloket.nl/ondergrondgegevens). Currently, this package provides
functionality to request CPTs from the BRO when you provide a region of interest. The format is based on the REST API of the BRO, which is described [here](https://publiek.broservices.nl/sr/cpt/v1/swagger-ui/#/default/) for CPTs.

Current options include retrieval of the following objects: 
1. CPTs (format: bytes, dict)

The package also allows export of the retrieved data in GeoJSON format. 

**Note 1**: The BRO is only available for the Netherlands, other locations are not supported.

**Note 2**: The API of the BRO is limited and requesting large amounts of data may result in instability.

## Installation

```python
pip install bro
```

## Use
Example usage to retrieve CPTs from the BRO as dictionaries. 
```python
from datetime import datetime

import Envelope
import Point
import get_cpt_characteristics_and_return_cpt_objects

begin_date = datetime(2015, 1, 1).strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
end_date = datetime(2023, 3, 3).strftime("%Y-%m-%d")

# Define small square area that returns 5 valid cpts
lower_corner = Point(51.92269686635185, 4.469594207611851)
upper_corner = Point(51.923034432171065, 4.470094707426648)

area = Envelope(lower_corner, upper_corner)
cpts = get_cpt_characteristics_and_return_cpt_objects(begin_date, end_date, area, as_dict= True)


```
