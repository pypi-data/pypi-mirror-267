# PathSaver

PathSaver is a Python script for saving, listing, and managing directory paths.

## Installation

You can install PathSaver via pip:

After installation, you can use the `pathsaver` command-line utility to save, list, delete, and copy directory paths.

### Save a Path

To save a directory path with a custom variable name, use the following command:

Replace `<variable_name>` with the name you want to assign to the directory path and `<directory_path>` with the actual directory path you want to save.

```bash
pathsaver --list
```

### Delete a Saved Path

To delete a saved path by variable name, use the following command:

```bash
pathsaver --delete <variable_name>
```

Replace `<variable_name>` with the name of the variable you want to delete.

### Delete All Saved Paths

To delete all saved paths, use the following command:

```bash
pathsaver --delete-all
```

### Copy a Saved Path to Clipboard

To copy a saved path to the clipboard, use the following command:

```

Replace `<variable_name>` with the name of the variable whose path you want to copy.
