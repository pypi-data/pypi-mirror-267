This tool allows you to run pytests with ipdb debugger while inserting breakpoints on the fly. This workflow makes sense if you practice "user-scenario-oriented development". In this practice every test should represent an actual "battlefield" scenario your code can encounter in the hands of the user. This makes tests very informative and allows you to have a built-in "literate programming" of sorts: scenarios are tests, but they can also function as tutorials, so they represent both validation of your code and documentation for your code.
