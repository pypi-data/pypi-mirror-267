## Installation

```bash
$ pip install py_predpurchase
```

## Usage

```py_predpurchase``` can be used to:

* Apply preprocessing transformations to the data, including scaling, encoding, and passing through features as specified.
* Calculate the cross validation results for a four common off-the-shelf models (Dummy, KNN, SVM and RandomForests)
* Fit a given model, and extract feature importances, sorted in descending order, and returns them as a DataFrame.
* Calculate the classification metrics for model predictions including precision, recall, accuracy and F1 scores.

*Please refer to the 'Example usage' page on the [Read the Docs](https://py-predpurchase.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) package documentation for a step by step, demonstration of each function in this package.*

Below is an example usage for one of our functions, `calculate_classification_metrics` 

``` python

import numpy as np
from py_predpurchase.function_classification_metrics import calculate_classification_metrics

# dummy data
y_true = [1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1]
y_pred = [1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0]

# using the function
calculate_classification_metrics(y_true, y_pred)

```

## Other packages

`pandas`: While Pandas is an extensive tool for data manipulation, py_predpurchase specializes in e-commerce analytics, offering tailored functionalities that go beyond general data handling. It includes advanced features for importing e-commerce datasets, detecting unique shopping-related variables etc.py_predpurchase is for refined insights that are specifically geared towards optimizing online shopping platforms and driving sales.

`scikit-learn`: Scikit-learn excels in model building, but py_predpurchase extends its offerings by providing advanced tools for interpreting model outcomes. Unlike scikit-learn's broader approach, our package includes specific methods for detailing the impact of each predictor on the purchasing decision, allowing for a deeper understanding of model dynamics and more accurate validation scores. py_predpurchase benefits from these specialized insights and improve your model's predictive performance in the context of online shopping.
