def get_feature_importances(model, X_columns):
    """
    Fits the model, extracts feature importances, sorts them, and returns them as a DataFrame.
    
    Parameters:
    ----------
    - model: The trained machine learning model with a feature_importances_ attribute.
    - X_columns: The column names of the features in entered dataset.

    Returns:
    ----------
    pandas.DataFrame
    - DataFrame: 
        - 1 column containing the feature importances sorted in descending order. 
        - index of DataFrame has feature names

    Examples:
    --------
    - Assuming:
        - random_forest is your RandomForestClassifier instance
        - X_train.columns is your feature names
        >>> feature_importances_df = get_feature_importances(random_forest, X_train.columns)


    Notes: 
    -------
    This function uses the pandas library produce the results as a pandas DataFrame.
