task_executor.scenes.extend([
    WorldScene(interaction, feature_set),
    StartScene(interaction, feature_set),
    MonthlyCardScene(interaction, feature_set),
    DialogCloseButtonScene(interaction, feature_set),
    DialogChoicesScene(interaction, feature_set),
    DialogPlayingScene(interaction, feature_set),
    BlackDialogScene(interaction, feature_set),
