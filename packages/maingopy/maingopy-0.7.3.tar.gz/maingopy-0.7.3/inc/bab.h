 * @brief This class contains the main algorithm, including handling of pre-processing routines and managing the B&B tree as well as the respective sub-solvers
 *
 * The class BranchAndBound implements a basic branch-and-bound (BaB) solver with some simple features for range reduction.
 * These include optimization-based range reduction (OBBT; cf., e.g., Gleixner et al., J. Glob. Optim. 67 (2017) 731), which can be conducted multiple times at the root node, and also once at every
 * node of the BAB tree, as well as duality-based bounds tightening (DBBT) and probing (cf. Ryoo&Sahinidis, Comput. Chem. Eng. 19 (1995) 551).
 * It also contains a multi-start local search from randomly generated initial points at the root node. Lower and upper bounding are conducted by the respective lower and upper bounding solvers (LBS / UBS).
