Command line interface for building, running, debugging, and disassembling the
ArchAdept training course example projects.


## Introduction

Many of the lessons on our training courses involve practical coding exercises
for you to complete, or example code snippets for you to modify and run yourself
on simulated hardware.

One challenge often faced by newcomers to bare metal ARM architecture development
like this is getting all of the necessary tools installed and configured, especially
when accounting for all the differences between the Mac, Linux, and Windows
operating systems.

The ArchAdept CLI solves this issue by leveraging Docker containers "under-the-hood"
to provide a consistent environment that is preloaded and preconfigured with all
of the tools required to build, run, debug, and disassemble the ArchAdept training
course example projects, while abstracting away all of the complexities of managing
the actual Docker containers themselves.

| Command | Description                                                                |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `make`  | Invoke an ArchAdept project Makefile.                                      |
| `run`   | Run an ArchAdept project on a QEMU simulation of real hardware.            |
| `debug` | Attach debugger to an ArchAdept project running on a live QEMU simulation. |
| `pull`  | Pull the latest backend Docker image.                                      |
| `prune` | Cleanup any lingering Docker containers.                                   |


### `make`

```console
usage: archadept make [-h] [-v] [-p PROJECT] [-i IMAGE] [-t TAG] [TARGET]

Invokes an ArchAdept example project Makefile.

options:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -v          enable logging verbose debug messages

command-specific options:
  -p PROJECT    path to the ArchAdept project (default: current directory)
  -i IMAGE      override Docker image repository (default: archadept/archadeptcli-backend)
  -t TAG        override Docker image tag (default: latest)
  -S            interleave source with disassembly (only available for 'dis' target)
  -O {0,1,2,3}  override project's default optimization level

command-specific positional arguments:
  TARGET      Makefile target from {all,clean,rebuild,dis,syms} (default: all)
```

The following targets are defined by all ArchAdept training course example
project Makefiles:
 - `all` builds the project.
 - `clean` deletes all of a project's build artifacts.
 - `rebuild` performs a clean build, equivalent to `clean` followed by `all`.
 - `dis` rebuilds the project, then disassembles it.
 - `syms` rebuilds the project, then dumps its symbol table.
 - `sects` rebuilds the project, then dumps its section headers.

Note: The `dis` target accepts the following optional flags:
 - `-S` enables interleaving source code with the disassembly.


### `run`

```console
usage: archadept run [-h] [-v] [-p PROJECT] [-i IMAGE] [-t TAG] [-s]

  -v          enable logging verbose debug messages

command-specific options:
  -p PROJECT  path to the ArchAdept project (default: current directory)
