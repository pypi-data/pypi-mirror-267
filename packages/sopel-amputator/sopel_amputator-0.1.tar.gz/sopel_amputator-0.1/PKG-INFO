# sopel-amputator

Sopel plugin that detects AMP links and finds their canonical forms using
[AmputatorBot](https://www.amputatorbot.com/)

## Installing

Releases are hosted on PyPI, so after installing Sopel, all you need is `pip`:

```shell
$ pip install sopel-amputator
```

## Configuring

The easiest way to configure `sopel-amputator` is via Sopel's
configuration wizard—simply run `sopel-plugins configure amputator`
and enter the values for which it prompts you.

Individual settings are described below.

### `ignore_domains`

This is a list of hostnames which `sopel-amputator` will ignore, even if they
match one of the common AMP substrings it looks for. By default it contains a
set of ignored domains from the AmputatorBot project.

The default list is _overridden_ when setting this value, so make sure to also
enter any of the default entries you want to keep.


## Changelog

### 0.1.0

Initial release.

Pending conversion from `setup.py`+`setup.cfg` template to newer style package
using `pyproject.toml`—plus some other features on the todo list—but the basics
are here:

* Detect likely AMP links
* Call AmputatorBot API for the canonical URL of each suspected AMP link
* Skip links from a configurable list of ignored domains
* Silently fail if no better URL is found
