Below is the solution provided, including the classes and methods necessary for the functionality described. This solution includes the following:
- EducationalContent: Represents the educational content, including a list of quests and tutoring sessions.
- Quest: Represents a quest, consisting of a title, a unique identifier, a creator, and a list of questions.
- TutoringSession: Represents a tutoring session, consisting of a unique identifier for the session, a unique identifier for the student, a quest related to the tutoring session, and the responses provided during the tutoring session.
- DialogueManager: responsible for managing the dialogue, processing responses, evaluating correctness, generating insights, and maintaining the current conversation.
- SocraticAISystem: The main component which integrates the EducationalContent, DialogueManager, and FeedbackAndEvaluation.
