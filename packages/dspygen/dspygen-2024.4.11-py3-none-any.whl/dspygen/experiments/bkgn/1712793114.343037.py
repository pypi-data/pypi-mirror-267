The provided `Example Io` and `Challenge Description` do not contain a specific coding challenge or problem to solve. As a result, I cannot generate a solution without a clear question or problem statement.

The following is a general template for a complex and elegant code solution for a FAANG interview-style coding challenge:

1. Begin with a comprehensive, multi-part docstring that covers:
   a. A brief description of the problem being solved.
   b. Expected input and output formats.
   c. An overview of the approach and algorithms used.
   d. Time and space complexity analysis.

2. Create a separate module for each data structure and algorithm component of the solution. This makes the code more modular, reusable, and maintainable. For example, if the problem involves graphing algorithms and data, the project should have the following structure:

```
project/
|-- docs/
|   |-- README.md
|   |-- solution.md
|
|-- graphing/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- algebraic_structures.py
|   |-- graph_algorithm.py
|
|-- input_output/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- input_handler.py
|   |-- output_generator.py
|
|-- main.py
```

3. Make the code readable, well-organized, and adhere to the Zen of Python:
```
import this
```

Incorporate these ideas and the provided `SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS` into the given template while addressing a specific coding challenge to create a customized solution.
