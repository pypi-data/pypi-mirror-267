(Note: The actual implementation and the level of complexity/elegance required for the FAANG interview-style coding challenges can't be fully demonstrated here. The following response only attempts to sketch out a scalable high-level structure.)

---
SYSTEM OVERVIEW:
- `system` dir: Root directory of the meta prompting application.
- `user_interaction` dir: Handles user interaction, UI, and user-related logic.
- `educational_content` dir: Educational content, quests, and questions management.
- `feedback_and_evaluation` dir: Feedback, evaluation, and scoring-related logic.
- `dialogue_manager` dir: Dialogue handling, Socratic questioning, insight generation.
- `socratic_ai_system` dir: Hyperdimensional meta-prompting, report generation, scalability.

The structure provided should be suitable as a starting point for developing such a system. You should continuously refine and document the individual components according to the requirements, testing them in-depth to achieve a fully functional and usable Meta Prompt Application capable of showcasing FAANG interview-style coding excellence.
