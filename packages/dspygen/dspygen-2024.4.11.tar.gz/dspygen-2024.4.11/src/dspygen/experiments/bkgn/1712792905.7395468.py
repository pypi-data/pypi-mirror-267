The educational\_content.py module defines the `EducationalContent` class that orchestrates a list of quests and tutoring sessions. The `Quest` class is designed to manage quests efficiently, including adding, removing, validating, and assigning a creator for each quest. Additionally, a main function is included to showcase the core functionality, validate the code, and serve as a starting point for further integration in the microservices architecture.
