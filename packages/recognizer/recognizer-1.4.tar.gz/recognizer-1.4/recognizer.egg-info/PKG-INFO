# reCognizer v1.4

#### reCognizer is a free-to-use AI based [reCaptcha](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha) Solver. <br> Usable with an easy-to-use API, also available for Async and Sync Playwright. <br> You can pass almost any format into the Challenger, from full-page screenshots, only-captcha images and no-border images to single images in a list.

#### Note: You Should use an undetected browser engine like [Botright](https://github.com/Vinyzu/Botright) to solve the Captchas consistently. <br>  reCaptcha detects normal Playwright easily and you probably wont get any successful solves despite correct recognitions.

## Install it from PyPI

```bash
pip install recognizer
```

## Basic Usage

```py
# Only for Type-Hints
from typing import TypeVar, Sequence, Union
from pathlib import Path
from os import PathLike

accepted_image_types = TypeVar("accepted_image_types", Path, Union[PathLike[str], str], bytes, Sequence[Path], Sequence[Union[PathLike[str], str]], Sequence[bytes])

# Real Code
from recognizer import Detector

detector = Detector()

task_type: str = "bicycle"
images: accepted_image_types = "recaptcha_image.png"
area_captcha: bool = False

response, coordinates = detector.detect(task_type, images, area_captcha=area_captcha)
```

---

## Playwright Usage
### Sync Playwright

```py
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright, Playwright
from recognizer.agents.playwright import SyncChallenger


def run(playwright: Playwright):
    browser = playwright.chromium.launch()
    page = browser.new_page()

    challenger = SyncChallenger(page)
    page.goto("https://recaptcha-demo.appspot.com/recaptcha-v2-checkbox-explicit.php")

    challenger.solve_recaptcha()

    browser.close()


with sync_playwright() as playwright:
    run(playwright)
```


### Async Playwright

```py
import asyncio

from playwright.async_api import async_playwright, Playwright
from recognizer.agents.playwright import AsyncChallenger


async def run(playwright: Playwright):
    browser = await playwright.chromium.launch()
    page = await browser.new_page()

    challenger = AsyncChallenger(page)
    await page.goto("https://recaptcha-demo.appspot.com/recaptcha-v2-checkbox-explicit.php")

    await challenger.solve_recaptcha()

    await browser.close()


async def main():
    async with async_playwright() as playwright:
        await run(playwright)


asyncio.run(main())
```
