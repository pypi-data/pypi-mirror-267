scmopy: Distribution-Agnostic Structural Causal Models Optimization in Python

The scmopy package is a composite package for causal discovery/analysis using several novel types of SCM Optimization algorithms.
The package also incorporates Distribution-Agnostic methods for causal estimation, which enables deviations from the necessity of any specific distributional assumption.

Should you use the scmopy package, please cite the following articles.
