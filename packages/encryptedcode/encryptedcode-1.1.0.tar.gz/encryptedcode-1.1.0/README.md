# New Encoding Algorithm

This package is imported absolutely in your .py files, for example: 'from encryptedcode.encrypted_code import encode', and contains two functions, one for encoding called encode() and another for decoding called decode() using the new L0123 algorithm created by Ing Software Leandro Gonzalez Espinosa
