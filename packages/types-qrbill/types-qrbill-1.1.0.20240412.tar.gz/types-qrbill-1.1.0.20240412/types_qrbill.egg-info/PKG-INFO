## Typing stubs for qrbill

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`qrbill`](https://github.com/claudep/swiss-qr-bill) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`qrbill`.

This version of `types-qrbill` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `qrbill==1.1.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/qrbill. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `6883b80f5286c7c8d540fa56b4fbf49364719e18` and was tested
with mypy 1.9.0, pyright 1.1.358, and
pytype 2024.3.19.
