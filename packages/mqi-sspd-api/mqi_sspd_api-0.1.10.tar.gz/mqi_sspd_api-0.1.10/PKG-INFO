# MQI Managing Module API

This is the official API made for the MQI biasing box. It allows you to interface
with the biasing box to set/read/update biases.

## Quickstart 

### Install pip package
Start of by installing the pip package write the following in your terminal window:

```
pip install mqi-sspd-api
```

Make sure you have python version higher than 3.0 installed (type python --version in 
a terminal window).


Once you have the package installed you can start using the API! 

### Connecting to the bias box
Start by importing the api into your project. You will usually just work with the MQI
object.

```
from mqi.v1.api import MQI
m = MQI("ws://mqicontroller.local", "8080")
m.connect()
```

You will communicate with the bias box using a websocket. To intiate this connection
you will need to know the host of the bias box (this will usually be indicated by 
a sticker on the biasing box).

If you can run this without getting any error you have successfully connected and 
can start sending messages.

### Set a biasing current
To set a current you use the setBias function

```
m.setCurrent("3", "2")
```

This will set the bias on channel **3** to **2 mA**.

### Get a bias current
You can either get all the channels at once or just the channel that you request

```
# Get the bias of channel 3
m.getBias("3")

# Get all biases of arduino 0
m.getAllBias(0)
```
