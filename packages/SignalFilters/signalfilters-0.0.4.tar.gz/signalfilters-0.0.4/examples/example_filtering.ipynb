    "#### Some background information\n",
    "\n",
    "In the signal processing tool box three base filters have been implemented: \n",
    "1. Ideal block filter (*bandpass_block_filter*, equivalent to the Matlab *band_pass2* filter by RvD) \n",
    "2. Kaiser filter (*kaiser_bandpass_filter*)\n",
    "3. Butterworth filter (*butter_bandpass_filter*). \n",
    "\n",
    "All filters need at least a low or a high cut-off frequency as an input argument. In case only a low cut off frequency is passed, all three filters will behave as high-pass filter (as only the frequencies below f_cut_low are suppressed), whereas in case only a high cut off frequency is passed, all filters will behave as a low pass-filter (as only the frequencies above the f_cut_high are suppressed). In case both the low and high cut-off frequency are given, all filters will behave as a band pass filter. The cut off frequencies are given in Hz. Next to at least one cut-off frequency, another mandotary argument is the sample frequency *f_sample*, which is also given in Hz.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *kaiser_bandpass_filter* and *butter_bandpass_filter* are in fact front ends to the *scipy* filters. In order to use the scipy filter quite some steps are required to calculate the filter coefficients. The implementations in this ** package take care of that and then call *scipy* filters. On top of the base filters an extra front end is defined, *filter_signal*, which receives the same input arguments as all three filtered mentioned above, plus an argument *filter_type*. Using this function we can pick which filter we want to use: *kaiser*, *block* or *butterworth*. The default choice is *kaiser*.\n",

The number of coefficients increases when we decrease the filter edge width (controlled by the *f_width_edge* argument), i.e. the transition width from the stop band to the pass band. The sharper this edge, the wider the filter spectrum and the better we approach an ideal band pass filter. To be sure that we use enough point we have picked quite a long time series with in total 10,000 samples, which is definitly long enough for this case."

    "Looking at the whole time series in show in the top left it can be understood why filtering the signal is more difficult this tie: around t=240s a sudden peak in the signal if found and also a very iregular low frequecy component is present in the signal (this peak is found at 0.0025 Hz and clipped in the figure at the top-right to have a better view on the lower peaks)\n",
    "\n",
    "The filtered time series at the bottom -left figure show that all filters yield a result that almost equally well follows the motion of the wave frequent components. The spectral plot at the bottom right confirms this: in the stop band range all filter have an almost undisturbed representation of the original signal. For frequecies above the high cut off frequency of 0.25 Hz, the block and kaiser filters complete suppress the spectral components. The butter filter has a softer decay due to the stop band of the filter coefficient at order 3. Nevertheless, in the time domain this is hardly visible, so it the price to pay for a speed up of more than a factor 1,000 compared to the Kaiser filter and more than a factor 100 compared to the block filter."

    "In terms of speed the Butterworth filter is the big winner, so you should pick this filter it time is an issue. The amount of suppression outside of the filter-band is controlled by the order of the filter. However, picking an order which is too high will lead to divergence of the filter. An order=3 seems to be an optimal choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Block filter is very straight forward to use and almost completely removes all frequencies component outside the filter-band. Ringing of the filter is avoided by oversampling the signal. The filter is about 100 times slower than the Butterworth filter, but for this prices are a better able to suppresed the frequencies out side of the filter-band\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like the Butterworth filter, the Kaiser filter has some handles to tune and find a trade-off between filter quality and processin time. For smaller edge width and high stop band values, the kaiser filter approaches the ideal filter properties of the block filter, but the filter becomes slower. By picking a more modest value for the filter edge width (like 0.05 Hz) combined with a stop band of 200 dB, the filter quality is fine and the filter time is not effected by the input signal.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the observations above, it is therefore recommended to use the block filter: the best fitler behaviour is achieved for only a bit more calculation time. In terms of filter performance the Kaiser filter does equalily well as the block filter, but we need to wait 10 x longer to get a result. The Butherworth filter is a fairly good filter and extremely fast, so if time is critical this filter could be used."
