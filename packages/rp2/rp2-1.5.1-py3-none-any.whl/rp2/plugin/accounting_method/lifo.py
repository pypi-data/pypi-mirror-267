# LIFO plugin. See https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifo.asp. This plugin uses universal application, not per-wallet application:
# this means there is one queue for each coin across every wallet and exchange and the accounting method is applied to each such queue.
# More on this at https://www.forbes.com/sites/shehanchandrasekera/2020/09/17/what-crypto-taxpayers-need-to-know-about-fifo-lifo-hifo-specific-id/
# Note that under LIFO the date acquired must still be before or on the date sold: for details see
