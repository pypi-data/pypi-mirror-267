# EmbedAnything


EmbedAnything is a powerful library designed to streamline the creation and management of embedding pipelines. Whether you're working with text, images, audio, or any other type of data[Multimodality to be added], EmbedAnything makes it easy to generate embeddings from multiple sources and store them efficiently in a vector database.

## Key Features

- **Flexible:** Build custom embedding pipelines tailored to your needs.
- **Efficient:** Optimized for speed and performance, with core functionality written in Rust.
- **Scalable:** Store embeddings in a vector database for easy retrieval and scalability.
- **Python Interface:** Packaged as a Python library for seamless integration into your existing projects.

##ToDo
- **Versatile:** Supports a wide range of data types, including text, images, audio, and more.
- **Local embeddings** Release it for local embeddings as well
- **Vector Database** Add functionalities to integrate with any Vector Database
## Installation

`
pip install embed-anything`


Requirements:




## Script:

**Do not forget to check out test.py on Github**

### PDFs texts with OpenAI, make sure you have openai key in the environment variable.
```python
import embed_anything
from embed_anything import EmbedData
data = embed_anything.embed_file("filename.pdf")
```

### Local Embedding for files,

```python
data:list[EmbedData] = embed_anything.embed_file("test_paper.pdf", embeder= "Bert")
embeddings = np.array([data.embedding for data in data])
```

### Create Image Embeddings

```python
data:list[EmbedData] = embed_anything.embed_directory("directory/images", embeder= "Clip")
embeddings = np.array([data.embedding for data in data])
```
