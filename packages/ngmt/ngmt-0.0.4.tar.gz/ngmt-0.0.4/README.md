Welcome to the NeuroGeriatricMotionToolbox (NGMT). We are a Python based toolbox for processing motion data.

!!! warning

    The toolbox is currently under development and is not yet ready for use.


The toolbox is aimed at motion researchers who want to use python based open source software to process their data.
We have implemented validated algorithms in modules to process motion data, such as:
   - Gait sequence detection (GSD)
   - Inital contact detection (ICD)
   - Physical activity monitoring (PAM)
   - Postural transition detection (SSD)
   - More to follow ...

The idea is that various motion data can be loaded into our dedicated dataclass which rely on principles from the [Motion-BIDS](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modality-specific-files/motion.html) standard.

## Data classes
### Data classes: conceptual framework

Motion data is recorded with many different systems and modalities, each with their own proprietary data format. NGMT deals with this by organizing both data and metadata in a [BIDS-like format](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modality-specific-files/motion.html). The BIDS format suggests that [motion recording data](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modality-specific-files/motion.html#motion-recording-data) from a single tracking system is organized in a single `*_tracksys-<label>_motion.tsv` file. 

!!! note

    A tracking system is defined as a group of motion channels that share hardware properties (the recording device) and software properties (the recording duration and number of samples).

In NGMT, data from a single tracking system is therefore loaded into a single `pandas.DataFrame`. The column headers of this `pandas.DataFrame` refer to the channels, and the corresponding [channels information](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modality-specific-files/motion.html#channels-description-_channelstsv) is likewise available as a `pandas.DataFrame`.

Similarly, if any [events](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modality-specific-files/task-events.html) are available for the given recording, these are loaded into a single `pandas.DataFrame` for each tracking system as well. The events derived from the toolbox can be exported to a BIDS like '*_events.tsv' file.

### Data classes: in practice
These concepts are translated into a NGMT dataclass for each recording: `NGMTRecording`:
```mermaid
classDiagram
   class NGMTRecording {
      data: dict[str, pd.DataFrame]
      channels: dict[str, pd.DataFrame]
      info: None | dict[str, Any] = None
      events: None | dict[str, pd.DataFrame] = None
      events_info: None | dict[str, Any] = None
      add_events(tracking_system, new_events)
      add_info(key, value)
      export_events(file_path, tracking_system=None, file_name=None, bids_compatible_fname=False)
   }

```
 A recording consists of the motion data from one or more tracking systems, where each tracking system may consist motion data from one or more tracked points. Therefore, the motion data (`NGMTRecording.data`) are organized as a dictionary where the dictionary keys refer to the tracking systems, and the corresponding values the actual (raw) data as a `pandas.DataFrame`. The description of data channels (`NGMTRecording.channels`) is availabe as a dictionary with the same keys, and the values contain the channels description.

!!! note

    In the examples you find a [tutorial (the basics of NGMT)](https://neurogeriatricskiel.github.io/NGMT/examples/00_tutorial_basics/) that explains the basics of the dataclass and how to work with them.
