If you forget this busywork, new feature branches will\n  need to create this section, which increases the chance of merge conflicts.\n- If a feature branch adds a change log entry to the section for the next v2.0\n  release, and v2.0 subsequently releases without merging that feature branch,\n  then merging that feature branch afterwards would still add the change log\n  entry to the v2.0 section, even though it should now go to the unreleased v3.0\n  section.\n\nLife would be a lot easier if you didn't have to deal with these problems.\n\nEnter Protokolo\n([Esperanto for 'report' or 'minutes'](https://vortaro.net/#protokolo)). The\nidea is very simple: for every change log entry, create a new file. Finally,\njust before release, compile the contents of those files into a new section in\nCHANGELOG, and delete the files.\n\n### See also\n\n[Towncrier](https://github.com/twisted/towncrier) is an older and more widely\nused implementation of the same idea. Protokolo is distinct in that it uses a\ndirectory hierarchy instead of putting all metadata in the file name of each\nchange log fragment. Furthermore, Protokolo does no fancy formatting of\nfragments---what you write is what you get.\n\nThere are three main problems I encountered in Towncrier that Protokolo attempts\nto address:\n\n- When using Towncrier, I would always forget which fragment types are available\n  to me and had to look them up. These fragment types can also differ per\n  repository. In Protokolo, the types are always visible because they are\n  directories.\n- Towncrier fragments are sorted by their ID, which is typically an issue or PR\n  number. This isn't always what I want.\n- Because (some) Towncrier workflows put the PR number in the file name as\n  metadata, I would have to open the PR before I could create the change log\n  fragment.\n\nA much younger version of me also tried her hand at writing a program like this\nin [changelogdir](https://pypi.org/project/changelogdir/).\n\n## Install\n\nProtokolo is a regular Python package. You can install it using\n`pipx install protokolo`. Make sure that `~/.local/share/bin` is in your `$PATH`\nwith `pipx ensurepath`.\n\n## Usage\n\nFor full documentation and options, read the documentation at\n<https://protokolo.readthedocs.io>.\n\n### Initial set-up\n\nTo set up your project for use with Protokolo, run `protokolo init`. This will\ncreate a `CHANGELOG.md` file (if one did not already exist) and a directory\nstructure under `changelog.d`. The directory structure uses the\n[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) sections, and ends up looking\nlike this:\n\n```\n.\n├── changelog.d\n│   ├── added\n│   │   └── .protokolo.toml\n│   ├── changed\n│   │   └── .protokolo.toml\n│   ├── deprecated\n│   │   └── .protokolo.toml\n│   ├── fixed\n│   │   └── .protokolo.toml\n│   ├── removed\n│   │   └── .protokolo.toml\n│   ├── security\n│   │   └── .protokolo.toml\n│   └── .protokolo.toml\n├── CHANGELOG.md\n└── .protokolo.toml\n```\n\nThe `.protokolo.toml` files in `changelog.d` contain metadata for their\nrespective sections: the section title, heading level, and order. Their\ninclusion is mandatory.\n\nThe `.protokolo.toml` file in the root of the project contains configurations\nfor Protokolo that reduce the amount of typing you need to do when running\ncommands.\n\nIf a `CHANGELOG.md` file already existed, make sure to add a line containing\n`<!-- protokolo-section-tag -->` just before the heading of the latest release.\n\n### Adding fragments\n\nTo add a change log fragment, create the file `changelog.d/added/my_feature.md`,\nand write something like:\n\n```markdown\n- Added `--my-new-feature` option.\n```\n\nNote the bullet at the start---Protokolo does not add them for you. What you\nwrite is exactly what you get.\n\nYou can add more files. Change log fragments in the same section (read:\ndirectory) are sorted alphabetically by their file name. If you want to make\ncertain that some change log fragments go first or last, prefix the file with\n`000_` or `zzz_`. For example, you can create\n`changelog.d/added/000_important_feature.md` to make it appear first.\n\n### Compiling your change log\n\nYou compile your change log with `protokolo compile`. This will take all change\nlog fragments from `changelog.d` and put them in your `CHANGELOG.md`. If we run\nit now, the following section is added after the\n`<!-- protokolo-section-tag -->` comment:\n\n```markdown\n## ${version} - 2023-11-08\n\n### Added\n\n- Added important feature.\n- Added `--my-new-feature` option.\n```\n\nThe Markdown files in `changelog.d/added/` are deleted. You can manually replace\n`${version}` with a release version, or you can pass the option\n`--format version 1.0.0` to `protokolo compile` to format the heading at compile\ntime.\n\n## Maintainers\n\n- Carmen Bianca BAKKER <carmen@carmenbianca.eu>\n\n## Contributing\n\nThe code and issue tracker is hosted at\n<https://codeberg.org/carmenbianca/protokolo>.
