Solace and seeks permission in writing.

1.3.	Publicly Available Software. The APIs may include software programs 
that are distributed by Solace pursuant to the terms and conditions of a 
license granted by the copyright owner of such software programs and which 
governs Licensee's use of such software programs ("Publicly Available 
Software"). The Licensee's use of Publicly Available Software in conjunction 
with the APIs in a manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement is 
permitted, however, the Licensee may have broader rights under the applicable 
license for Publicly Available Software and nothing contained herein is 
intended to impose restrictions or limitations on the Licensee's use of the 
Publicly Available Software.

2.	TERM AND TERMINATION. 

This Agreement will commence upon Licensee's first use of an API and will 
continue unless and until earlier terminated as set forth herein. If Licensee 
breaches any of its conditions or obligations under this Agreement, this 
Agreement and the License will terminate automatically and permanently. 

3.	INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

reserves all rights in its trademarks and service marks, and no licenses 
therein are granted in this Agreement. Subject to Solace's rights in the APIs,
