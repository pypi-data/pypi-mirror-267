# Hello, World!

## Creating a project

Assuming you have Proton installed (if you don't, see [Installation](installation.md)), you can first create a directory for the project, and then create a new project using the built-in project management system.

`python -m proton project init --dir [project directory; argument not required if you are in the directory already]`
