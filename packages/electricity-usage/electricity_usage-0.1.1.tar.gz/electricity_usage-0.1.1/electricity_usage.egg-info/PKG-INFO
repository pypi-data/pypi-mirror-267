The electricity_usage package provides a scheduler which will kick off processes only when there is a surplus in local energy production.
For more information see the [usage](usage.html) documentation.

## Installation

The Python package `electricity_usage` can be installed by cloning the git repository and installing it using pip install.

```
pip install electricity_usage
```
To fully utilize this package, you also need a subscription to Electricity Maps, available here `<https://api-portal.electricitymaps.com/>`.  
Upon subscription, you'll receive an authentication token. This token is used to access additional electricity production and consumption data for specific locations from Electricity Maps.  
We incorporate the token using an optional parameter `--em_auth_token`, in our `start` command.  
Please note that the majority of locations do not require an authentication token.  
More information about Electricity Maps can be found in :ref:`api-ref`.
