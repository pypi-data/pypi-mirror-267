              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# GPTScript Python Module

## Introduction

The GPTScript Python module is a library that provides a simple interface to create and run gptscripts within Python applications, and Jupyter notebooks. It allows you to define tools, execute them, and process the responses.

## Installation

You can install the GPTScript Python module using pip.

```bash
pip install gptscript
```

On MacOS, Windows X6

### SDIST and none-any wheel installations

When installing from the sdist or the none-any wheel, the binary is not packaged by default. You must run the install_gptscript command to install the binary.

```bash
install_gptscript
```

The script is added to the same bin directory as the python executable, so it should be in your path.

Or you can install the gptscript cli from your code by running:

```python
from gptscript.install import install
install()
```

### Using an existing gptscript cli

If you already have the gptscript cli installed, you can use it by setting the envvar:

```bash
export GPTSCRIPT_BIN="/path/to/gptscript"
```

## Using the Module

The module requires the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable to be set with your OPENAI key. You can set it in your shell or in your code.

```bash
export OPENAI_AI_KEY="your-key"
```

## Tools

The `Tool` class represents a gptscript tool. The fields align with what you would be able to define in a normal gptscript .gpt file.

### Fields

- `name`: The name of the tool.
- `description`: A description of the tool.
- `tools`: Additional tools associated with the main tool.
- `max_tokens`: The maximum number of tokens to generate.
- `model`: The GPT model to use.
- `cache`: Whether to use caching for responses.
- `temperature`: The temperature parameter for response generation.
- `args`: Additional arguments for the tool.
- `internal_prompt`: Boolean defaults to false.
- `instructions`: Instructions or additional information about the tool.
- `json_response`: Whether the response should be in JSON format.(If you set this to True, you must say 'json' in the instructions as well.)

## Primary Functions

Aside from the list methods there are `exec` and `exec_file` methods that allow you to execute a tool and get the responses. Those functions also provide a streaming version of execution if you want to process the output streams in your code as the tool is running.

### Opts

You can pass the following options to the exec and exec_file functions:

opts= {
    "cache": True(default)|False,
    "cache-dir": "",
}

Cache can be set to true or false to enable or disable caching globally or it can be set at the individual tool level. The cache-dir can be set to a directory to use for caching. If not set, the default cache directory will be used.

### `list_models()`

This function lists the available GPT models.

```python
from gptscript.command import list_models

models = list_models()
print(models)
```

### `list_tools()`

This function lists the available tools.

```python
from gptscript.command import list_tools

tools = list_tools()
print(tools)
```

### `exec(tool, opts)`

This function executes a tool and returns the response.

```python
from gptscript.command import exec
from gptscript.tool import Tool

tool = Tool(
    json_response=True,
    instructions="""
Create three short graphic artist descriptions and their muses. 
These should be descriptive and explain their point of view.
Also come up with a made up name, they each should be from different
backgrounds and approach art differently.
the response should be in JSON and match the format:
{
   artists: [{
      name: "name"
      description: "description"
   }]
}
""",
    )


response = exec(tool)
print(response)
```

### `exec_file(tool_path, input="", opts)`

This function executes a tool from a file and returns the response. The input values are passed to the tool as args.

```python
from gptscript.command import exec_file

response = exec_file("./example.gpt")
print(response)
```

### `stream_exec(tool, opts)`

This function streams the execution of a tool and returns the output, error, and process wait function. The streams must be read from.

```python
from gptscript.command import stream_exec
from gptscript.tool import Tool

tool = Tool(
    json_response=True,
    instructions="""
Create three short graphic artist descriptions and their muses. 
These should be descriptive and explain their point of view.
Also come up with a made up name, they each should be from different
backgrounds and approach art differently.
the response should be in JSON and match the format:
{
   artists: [{
      name: "name"
      description: "description"
   }]
}
""",
    )

def print_output(out, err):
    # Error stream has the debug info that is useful to see
    for line in err:
        print(line)

    for line in out:
        print(line)

out, err, wait = stream_exec(tool)
print_output(out, err)
wait()
```

### `stream_exec_file(tool_path, input="",opts)`

This function streams the execution of a tool from a file and returns the output, error, and process wait function. The input values are passed to the tool as args.

```python
from gptscript.command import stream_exec_file

def print_output(out, err):
    # Error stream has the debug info that is useful to see
    for line in err:
        print(line)

    for line in out:
        print(line)

out, err, wait = stream_exec_file("./init.gpt")
print_output(out, err)
wait()
```

## Example Usage

```python
from gptscript.command import exec
from gptscript.tool import FreeForm, Tool

# Define a simple tool
simple_tool = FreeForm(
    content="""
What is the capital of the United States?
"""
)

# Define a complex tool
complex_tool = Tool(
    tools=["sys.write"],
    json_response=True,
    cache=False,
    instructions="""
    Create three short graphic artist descriptions and their muses.
    These should be descriptive and explain their point of view.
    Also come up with a made-up name, they each should be from different
    backgrounds and approach art differently.
    the JSON response format should be:
    {
        artists: [{
            name: "name"
            description: "description"
        }]
    }
    """
)

# Execute the complex tool
response, err = exec(complex_tool)
print(err)
print(response)

# Execute the simple tool
resp, err = exec(simple_tool)
print(err)
print(resp)
```

### Example 2 multiple tools

In this example, multiple tool are provided to the exec function. The first tool is the only one that can exclude the name field. These will be joined and passed into the gptscript as a single gpt script.

```python
from gptscript.command import exec
from gptscript.tool import Tool

tools = [
    Tool(tools=["echo"], instructions="echo hello times"),
    Tool(
        name="echo",
        tools=["sys.exec"],
        description="Echo's the input",
        args={"input": "the string input to echo"},
        instructions="""
        #!/bin/bash
        echo ${input}
        """,
    ),
]

resp, err = exec(tools)
print(err)
print(resp)
```
