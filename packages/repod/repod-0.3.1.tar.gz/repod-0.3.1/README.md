# repod
This project contains tooling to maintain binary package repositories for Linux
distributions using the [pacman](https://archlinux.org/pacman/) package manager.

The latest documentation can be found at
[repod.archlinux.page](https://repod.archlinux.page).

**NOTE**: *Repod is still alpha grade software and as such has not yet reached
its targeted feature set. It has not been thoroughly tested in the field and
therefore should not be used in a production environment!*

## Installation

alternatively by executing

```
pip install repod
```

Further information on optional requirements and setting up a development
environment can be found in the official [installation
instructions](https://repod.archlinux.page/repod/installation.html).
