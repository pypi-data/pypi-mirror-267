Package Contents
================

A package contains files that are installed on a target system as well as
additionals, which are only relevant for the package manager and the repository
management software (e.g. to create entries in the :ref:`management repository`
and :ref:`sync database`).

.. _package:

Package
-------

The metadata contained in a package is described by several components, which
are described in more detail in the sections for :ref:`mtree`, :ref:`buildinfo`
and :ref:`pkginfo`.

Package files are read and their contents parsed, which can subsequently be
described by a JSON schema.

Below is a list of currently understood versions of the schema.

.. _packagev1:

PackageV1
^^^^^^^^^

.. literalinclude:: ../schema/PackageV1.json
   :language: json

.. _packagev2:

PackageV2
^^^^^^^^^

This version removes the ``md5sum`` field as the hash algorithm is unsafe.

.. literalinclude:: ../schema/PackageV2.json
   :language: json

.. _mtree:

.MTREE
------

The ``.MTREE`` files contained in a package are |mtree| files, which describe
the contents of a package. Entities such as directories, files and symlinks are
described in a binary format that lists their ownership, permissions, creation
date and various checksums.

Not all |mtree| keywords are used during package creation, which means that
only a subset of them are available in the eventual ``.MTREE`` file.

.. _mtree json schema:

MTreeEntry
^^^^^^^^^^

The entries of an ``.MTREE`` file are parsed and can subsequently be described
by a JSON schema.

Below is a list of currently understood versions of the schema.

.. _mtreeentryv1:

MTreeEntryV1
""""""""""""

.. literalinclude:: ../schema/MTreeEntryV1.json
   :language: json

.. _buildinfo:

.BUILDINFO
----------

The ``.BUILDINFO`` files contained in packages are |BUILDINFO| files, which
describe aspects of the build environment present during the creation of a
package.

Formats for the file are specified by |makepkg|. Its |write_buildinfo()|
function implements only the latest version of the available formats.

.. _buildinfo json schema:

BuildInfo
^^^^^^^^^

The entries in a ``.BUILDINFO`` file are parsed and can subsequently be
described by a JSON schema.

Below is a list of currently understood versions of the schema.

.. _buildinfov1:

BuildInfoV1
"""""""""""

.. literalinclude:: ../schema/BuildInfoV1.json
   :language: json

.. _buildinfov2:

BuildInfoV2
"""""""""""

.. note::

  If |devtools| has been used as ``buildtool``, the ``buildtoolver`` has to be
  of the form ``<optional_epoch><pkgver>-<pkgrel>-<arch>`` (e.g.
  ``20220207-1-any``)!

.. literalinclude:: ../schema/BuildInfoV2.json
   :language: json

.. _pkginfo:

.PKGINFO
--------

The ``.PKGINFO`` files contained in packages describe their metadata.

Formats for the file are specified by |makepkg|. Its |write_pkginfo()|
function implements only the latest version of the available formats.

.. _pkginfo json schema:

PkgInfo
^^^^^^^

The entries in a ``.PKGINFO`` file are parsed and can subsequently be described
by a JSON schema.

Below is a list of currently understood versions of the schema.

.. _pkginfov1:

PkgInfoV1
"""""""""

.. literalinclude:: ../schema/PkgInfoV1.json
   :language: json

.. _pkginfov2:

PkgInfoV2
"""""""""

In this version the optional ``xdata`` attribute has been introduced.

.. literalinclude:: ../schema/PkgInfoV2.json
   :language: json
