Management Repository
=====================

A management repository is a |version control repository|, that contains
machine readable descriptor files (i.e. |JSON|) which track the state of
:ref:`sync database` files and thus also of the :ref:`binary repository` they
describe.

Packages are gathered by ``pkgbase`` (see |PKGBUILD|) and the directory
structure follows a layout of **<CPU
architecture>**/**<repository>**/**<pkgbase>**, as the same repositories may
exist for several architectures.

.. _json_schema:

JSON Schema
-----------

The |JSON| files contained in a :ref:`management repository` can be validated
using |JSON schema|.

The schema is derived from |pydantic| models, that allow to describe various
input files related to a :ref:`sync database`.

.. _files_schema:

Files
^^^^^

This is the schema of files that belongs to an :ref:`outputpackage_schema`.

Below is a list of currently understood versions of the schema.

.. _filesv1_schema:

FilesV1
"""""""

.. note::

   This schema represents the definition of :ref:`files_v1`.

.. literalinclude:: ../schema/FilesV1.json
   :language: json

.. _outputbuildinfo_schema:

OutputBuildInfo
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the schema for an optional subset of an :ref:`outputpackagebase_schema`
representation in the :ref:`management repository`.
It is a subset of the :ref:`buildinfo json schema` data, which is retrieved
from parsing the contents of a package.

.. note::

  This data is *not* persisted in a :ref:`sync database` and can only be
  retrieved per :ref:`package` from a package file!

Below is a list of currently understood versions of the schema.

.. _outputbuildinfov1_schema:

OutputBuildV1
"""""""""""""

.. note::

  This schema is directly related to that of :ref:`buildinfov1`!

.. literalinclude:: ../schema/OutputBuildInfoV1.json
   :language: json

.. _outputbuildinfov2_schema:

OutputBuildV2
"""""""""""""

.. note::

  This schema is directly related to that of :ref:`buildinfov2`!

.. literalinclude:: ../schema/OutputBuildInfoV2.json
   :language: json

.. _outputpackagebase_schema:

OutputPackageBase
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the schema for a ``pkgbase`` file in the :ref:`management repository`.

.. note::

  In a |split package| scenario, the sum of information gathered from all
  packages, that belong to a given ``pkgbase`` comprise an
  :ref:`outputpackagebase_schema`.

Below is a list of currently understood versions of the schema.

.. _outputpackagebasev1_schema:

OutputPackageBaseV1
"""""""""""""""""""

.. literalinclude:: ../schema/OutputPackageBaseV1.json
   :language: json

.. _outputpackage_schema:

OutputPackage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the schema of a package that belongs to an
:ref:`outputpackagebase_schema`. It describes all properties that are unique to
the specific package and that are not also covered by the ``pkgbase``.

Below is a list of currently understood versions of the schema.

.. _outputpackagev1_schema:

OutputPackageV1
"""""""""""""""

.. literalinclude:: ../schema/OutputPackageV1.json
   :language: json

.. _outputpackagev2_schema:

OutputPackageV2
"""""""""""""""

This version removes the ``md5sum`` field as the hash algorithm is unsafe and
renders the ``pgpsig`` field optional to lower the size of the created
:ref:`sync database` files.

.. literalinclude:: ../schema/OutputPackageV2.json
   :language: json

.. _packagedesc_schema:

PackageDesc
^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the schema of package information found in a :ref:`desc` file of a
:ref:`sync database`.

Below is a list of currently understood versions of the schema.

.. _packagedescv1_schema:

PackageDescV1
"""""""""""""

.. note::

   This schema represents the definition of :ref:`desc_v1`.

.. literalinclude:: ../schema/PackageDescV1.json
   :language: json

.. _packagedescv2_schema:

PackageDescV2
"""""""""""""

This version removes the ``md5sum`` field as the hash algorithm is unsafe and
renders the ``pgpsig`` field optional to lower the size of the created
:ref:`sync database` files.
