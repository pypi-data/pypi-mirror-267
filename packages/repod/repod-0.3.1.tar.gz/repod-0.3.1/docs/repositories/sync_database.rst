Sync Database
=============

Pacman downloads remote database files, that it uses to synchronize its local
state with a remote :ref:`binary repository` and to figure out which packages
to download and upgrade.

The sync database files are tar files, that may be gzip, bzip2, xz or zstd
compressed. Two types of files are supported: Default sync databases
(suffixed with ``.db``) and files databases (suffixed with ``.files``).

.. note::

  There is only ever one version of a given package present in a repository.
  Although the :ref:`binary repository` may contain several versions of a
  package, the sync database ensures that only up to one is ever exposed to the
  user.

.. _default sync database:

Default Database
----------------

In the default database each package in its current version is represented by a
directory and a ``desc`` file::

  .
  ├── package-1.0.0-1
  │   └── desc
  [..]

A ``desc`` file carries identifiers and their values, which describe a package
(see :ref:`desc`).

.. _files sync database:

Files Database
--------------

In the files database each package in its current version is represented by a
directory containing a ``desc`` and a ``files`` file::

  .
  ├── package-1.0.0-1
  │   ├── desc
  │   └── files
  [..]

The ``desc`` file is the same as in the default database, while the ``files``
file represents the list of files of a given package (see :ref:`files`).

.. _desc:

Desc
----

Repository sync databases contain per-package ``desc`` files, that carry
identifiers and their values, which serve to describe a package.

Identifiers are composed of a string in all capital letters ``[A-Z]`` with a
leading and a trailing ``%`` character.
All identifiers as well as values are provided on a per-line basis in a
``desc`` file, leaving an empty line between each identifier/value pair.

Identifiers may be required or optional. As requirements change over time and
identifiers and their values may be added or removed, the ``desc`` files are
distinguished using the below versioning.

.. _desc_v1:

.. _desc_v2:

Desc v2
^^^^^^^

This version removes the ``%MD5SUM%`` field as this hashing algorithm is unsafe.
Furthermore the ``%PGPSIG%`` field has been made optional to lower the size of
the created :ref:`sync database` files.

.. _files:

Files
-----

The files repository sync databases contain per-package ``files`` files, that
carry identifiers and their values, which serve to describe the contents of a
package.

Identifiers are composed of a string in all capital letters ``[A-Z]`` with a
leading and a trailing ``%`` character.
All identifiers as well as values are provided on a per-line basis in a
``files`` file, leaving an empty line between each identifier/value pair.

Identifiers may be required or optional. As requirements change over time and
identifiers and their values may be added or removed, the ``files`` files are
distinguished using the below versioning.


.. _files_v1:

Files v1
^^^^^^^^

* ``%FILES%`` (**required**): A list of files and directories contained in a
  package (one file per line below the identifier)
