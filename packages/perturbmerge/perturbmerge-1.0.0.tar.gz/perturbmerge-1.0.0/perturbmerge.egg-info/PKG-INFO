Description: PerturbMerge is a Python package that predicts the impact of 485 specific gene knockouts on cell viability by analyzing single-cell transcriptomic data. It integrates single-cell transcriptomic sequencing data from 164 undisturbed cancer cell lines, along with corresponding essential gene screening information, and is trained using three ensemble learning algorithms: Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and XGBoost. This results in a comprehensive classifier capable of predicting the effects of specific gene knockouts on the survival and proliferation of single cells based on the input data.
