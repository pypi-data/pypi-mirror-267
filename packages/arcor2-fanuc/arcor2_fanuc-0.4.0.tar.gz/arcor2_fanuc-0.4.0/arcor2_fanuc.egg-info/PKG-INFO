# arcor2_fanuc

For the server to work, there must be a running [MAPPDK driver](https://github.com/torayeff/fanucpy) on the robot. So far, it has been tested with LRMate 200iD/7L (for which there is also a model, adapted from [ROS Industrial](https://github.com/ros-industrial/fanuc)), but it should work with any robot driven by the R-30iB Mate Plus Controller.
