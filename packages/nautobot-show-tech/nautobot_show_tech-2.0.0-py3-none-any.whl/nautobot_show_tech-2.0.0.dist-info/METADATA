## Overview

### Purpose: Providing diagnostics in a Nautobot environment

When troubleshooting an environment, it is best to be able to answer questions about the environment quickly. This process is challenging to perform with a back-and-forth with a customer. Therefore, Nautobot Show Tech is designed to aggregate and provide that information in an easy-to-consume format as a one-time ask. The goal is to aid in troubleshooting managed service customer environments, but it can be extended to do more or be used to meet stakeholder requirements.

### Versions: Nautobot 2.X or 1.X compatible

With the addition of commands using Nautobot ORM and Jobs, there is a requirement to have two versions of this plugin.  Nautobot Show Tech is therefore versioned in coordination with the Major Release version of Nautobot.  Nautobot Show Tech 2.X will support Nautobot 2.X environments. Nautobot Show Tech 1.X will support Nautobot 1.X environments.  Please be sure to use the appropriate version for best diagnostic return results.

### Screenshots

> Developer Note: Add any representative screenshots of the App in action. These images should also be added to the `docs/user/app_use_cases.md` section.

> Developer Note: Place the files in the `docs/images/` folder and link them using only full URLs from GitHub, for example: `![Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/networktocode/nautobot-app-show-tech/main/docs/images/plugin-overview.png)`. This absolute static linking is required to ensure the README renders properly in GitHub, the docs site, and any other external sites like PyPI.

More screenshots can be found in the [Using the App](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/nautobot-show-tech/en/latest/user/app_use_cases/) page in the documentation. Here's a quick overview of some of the plugin's added functionality:
