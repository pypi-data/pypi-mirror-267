""" Usage examples of the MyRIO class: MXP board tests

    This examples shows how to use the electronic components
    we already have on our MXP boards. It serves as example of
    more sophisticated functions we added to myRIO_base.

    Our MXP cards have an RGB LED connected to DIO_2:0 and 
    two push buttons on DIO_4:3. We also have an NTC temperature
    sensor in AI0 and an LDR light sensor in AI1. We use these
    channels in our examples. The port that we use most is the 
    A port, so we set it as default on our package.
